Review analysis of phone companies from Amazon

This project attempts to analyse the issues users of mobile phones from various manufacturers, including Apple, Oneplus, Vivo, and Samsung, encounter from customer reviews posted on Amazon.com and anticipate customer perception based on these reviews.


To run the project-
1. Download the folder and extract the files. (Make sure the .csv and .ipynb files are in the same directory)
2. Open the ipynb file using suitable compatible editor like Jupyter Notebook and run it.
