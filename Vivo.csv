    NO COST EMI OFFERS IN AMAZON
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This rating is not made for the product but to give you a warning of not falling for the NO COST EMI offer on credit card .Dont assume you get NO COST EMI on your HDFC Credit card by default when you make the transaction  .Be very careful when you click the option of payment and double check. The option will make you do full payment even if the option of EMI is mentioned below .DONT PROCEED unless you ENSURE this .Its not like the normal scheme where after the transaction is made you still get the EMI benefits as its the transaction date and time and amount and product scheme which is important .Neither AMAZON nor HDFC bank can help you after transaction is done

  Honest Review..If you are not hard core gammer than you will be happy with this mobile.1. Design : Very stylish and eye catching.  Looks very premium mobile.2. Display : Very smooth and crispy. AMOLED works perfectly fine.3. Battery : Charging is super fast and performance of bettery is quite good. Can lasy a day.4. Camera : The main highlight of this mobile is its camera. Vivo have did good job and camera is working amazing. Macro shots are nice. Ultra wide angle is amazing. Main camera takes pics in natural colors which is nice. Lots of features and options are in camera.Speaker is average could have been better. In box handzfee are usless.Overall performance is good.

  Just after a week I bought this phone, it started hanging. At the moment I opens 3-4 apps simultaneously it stops working. Even back, minimise and home button doesn't work at that time. Camera is good but it automatically beautifies the picture and we miss the actual photo. I think it is not at all value for money. I really regret myself for buying this phone.

  Hi if you are really concerned for the security of your phone and the data in your device never purchase Vivo Mobiles. I gifted VivoV19 to my wife and the face recognition lock opens for both my wife and her sister who is 1 year older. Vivo should be highly appreciated for the security they are coming up with. And i should be appreciated for spending 30+k for this kind of unworthy mobile

    VIVO V19 Smartphone Review
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am using this phone from last two months. Since then I am not able to find out a single fault in it. Its design is awesome. Rear camera's heavy look attracts every one. The best thing is, I got this phone in beautiful exchange offer. Camera quality is awesome and processing speed is too good. If we see its cost then such a good phone deserve 5000 MAH Battery Capacity. But this is having 4500 MAH. Vivo could have improved this one.  I am giving FIVE STARs to all things except battery 4 STARS.Thanks AMAZON

  Writing review after 15 days use. all hardware is good. charging is good.but vivo need to improve its UI. i switched from MI and i found some limitations in customising the home screen and UI. And the worst thing in vivo phones is that all themes are paid,even the wallpapers and the font style. overall nice handset and gives you a premium feel. weight distribution of this phone is really good. it won't feel heavy at all. smooth running apps. didn't face any issue yet. go for the mystic silver colour its really nice.

  Got it for just 15k during Amazon festive sale using exchange offer and bank offer.The phone looks modern and stylish and back glass is so beautiful. The fingerprint sensor is very fast, display is FHD+ Amoled which is sharp and brightness is good under sunlight. Camera is top notch with so many features and modifications that you certainly won't need additional softwares to edit images. The SD 712 is enough for non-gamers and it's power efficient too.Overall Vivo V19 is a great smartphone and is worth getting during the festive period as its original price is somewhat on the costlier side.

  Reviewing after 5 days.Design feels solid as front and back both protected by gorilla glass 6. Easy to hold. Not bulky. Weight around 185 grams. Which is well distributed.Piano black color is descent.Comes with Android 10.Display is amoled. Shifted from ips display. Finding amoled display much better. Display size is 6.44 inches. So phone is not too big.Touch response is smooth.No lags or hanging. Works very smoothHaven't played games yetCharges fast. Gets slightly warm while charging as it 33 watts fast charging but does not heat or overheatEarphones are gud.Although design feels like copied from Samsung s20 ultra.Speakers are loud amd clear.No network issue till now. Earpiece quality is gud and mic also receive the audio properly.There is call recording option and native video calling Option.Triple card slot. Much required. 6 cameras- 4 in the back and 2 in the front. Cameras are gud. Sometimes there are issues in exposure while capturing through front camera. Background is blown out. But it can be adjusted before or after clicking the image. After adjusting exposure,pics comes quite natural and detailed. Rear Camera has pro mode. Images from back camera are really gud, natural, detailed, sharp. Video recording upto 4k 30 fps. 1080p 60 fps also available.Lots of customization features.Coming to price. Too much. Considering the fact it is offline centric. 22k should have been the price with some additional offers.Back cover provided is really gud. Fits tightly.

  Vivo advertises its camera the most in its V series, and the front camera in this Vivo v19 is pathetic. Colour saturation is very very less and in bright sunlight it fails to capture the colours. You can check the quality of front camera photos that I've uploaded.  I compared it with another Vivo v19 and found this to be defective in my phone. And so I ordered a replacement for my phone but Amazon did not approve. That's very bad on Amazon's part. I will never order a mobile phone through Amazon again.

    Good Phone but Overpriced
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone Vivo V19 in itself is quite good, but it is not worth the price even after discounts. (Good that HDFC had no-cost EMI this sale.)Buy only if you're specifically interested in having a Vivo handset.Things I liked:* Fingerprint scanner is much better than Samsung and Oppo handsets of this range. Fast and Quick.* Face Unlock too is quite fast and better than Samsung devices.* This might sound amusing - I never got Volte in my VI (previously Idea) sim in any handset, but after inserting the sim in Vivo V19 I got Volte and now it works in all handsets!* FuntouchOS is the only smartphone UI to support Sanskrit as the phone/display language. No other OEM (including AOSP) have support for Sanskrit as a UI language.* The Cameras do their job decently although I wouldn't count on this device for my primary photography. The selfie mode brightens the screen which can be used in low light.Things I didn't like:* High price for low specs. Samsung M51 at the same price point gives better specs. M51 vs V19 - 64MP Quad vs 48MP Quad, SD 730G vs SD AIE, 7000mAh battery vs 4500mAh battery, 6.7"" display vs 6.44"" display.If you can wait longer buy the upcoming V20 (it has 3+1 cameras though unlike 4+2 here).This phone is *only* good if you want to own a Vivo device. Compared to other Vivo models available here, V19 currently is the best deal (provided you have a card that's giving instant discount and no-cost EMI). The positive things lie mostly in Vivo's software. Hardware wise it's just average.

Comparing to samsung, Vivo v19 camera is performing well.One thing, i hate im this phone is macro camera,  it is worst. Don't expect much from that.Image quality is Ok at this price(25k)Audio is loud and video also looking good.Sometimes, some apps automatically getting close while using(This is not i expected, it has given a bad experience in vivo)Selfie camera is good.Go for this phone, only you need good  camera experience. Otherwise avoid this go to other smartphones.Except camera, other features are not so good to differentiate it. Because the processor is slow when i compare this phone with other brands at this price.

  I was trying to get samsung M31s but there was stock issue and system errors while purchasing it, hence opted vivo v19 by seeing positive reviews on Amazon.Few things that I have observed and are critical too1. This phone is full of banned apps, even after system update, banned apps are there. I called vivo but i got surprised answers by vivo person that update will come and updates are on demand in vivo. That is shocking.2. I have not installed any games on it, so no heating issues, phone is charged 0-100% in 1.3 hrs3. Camera is dull if I compare it with Xiaomi or realme or oneplus, details are missing, too much customization, selfies are good, I like mono effect and Bokeh mode in videos4. It is good for day to day performance5. Design is good but back is fingerprint magnet, so apply back cover. Surprisingly I was not able to get good back cover like ringke or kapaver, hope to see it soonOverall it is highly overpriced, good for normal task, not sure for gaming, camera is average

  I have bought this phone at 29k and within 15days they have reduced the price. These mobiles can not think when the prices will fall down.  Pricing is always high for these mobiles.Best pick for Camera and VIdeosBattery backup not badSpeed is good because of 8GB ram and processor is bit outdated

  I have bought this phone because like the earlier phone which I used Redmi 6A, but this phone is not that worth due to these reasons - mobile is hanging frequently, camera quality is okay not that great and audio was also not that great and it's not able to connect wifi immediately and taking some time to connect and little weighter to handle it, I was completely disappointed with this product now and my return period also crossed so thought of continuing using this.

  Putting this review after 1 month of use.Its has a great camera, Battery and Amoled screen is just awesome. Speaker Volume is upto the mark. Fast charging works very well. Phone is very easy to handle and works perfectly fine. No Lags or delay after installing more than 150 Apps. Very smooth experience. Night Selfie mode is just superb. You can take a pic even in pitch black dark. There are many customized animated features available for the users. It has pre-installed many important features like Screen Record, Voice record during a call etc. The only factor for which I was upset was the delivery. There were minor visible scratches when the phone was delivered.

  Have been using it for almost two months now. Extremely satisfied with its performance. Really smooth & easy to operate phone. Looks sleek & elegant. Gives a premium feeling. Basically a camera centric phone. Selfie lovers will drool over it. Light weight & doesn't lag.The only problem I have faced is.. While making calls.. The person at the other end at times complains about not being able to hear my voice.. Though the sound quality of the phone is very good.

  This phone is not worth for 28k, performance is very bad. After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review.1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.  A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.  B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.  C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue.Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good.Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 1 for 5Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone. All the above complaints works randomly, I had screen recored and shots for proof to show.

  It is a very good phone with amazing performance ,camera quality and gaming mode is also superb bit its battery drains fast when playing very heavy games like pubg and cod in high graphics i can play any pf these games for only 5 to 6 hours only but game is very smooth. Bit i have used vivo z1 pro ot os better than this so if ypu are a gamer ypu should go for z1 pro or z1x.

  phone is Ok, but one star due to quality of service centre.Phone is good only till you have an issue and rush to the sparsely located service center. There you will waste whole day in queue and will be called the next day to pick up the phone (that too during office hours).

    Bought it for my dad, great midrange phone!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I wanted a midrange phone for my dad, be had iPhone 6s before. But did not want another 50k+ OnePlus, iphone, etc. because he doesn't have the need for those advanced features/specs. Nor the 10-15k Redmi phones that start hanging soon and have other problems.Vivo V19 fit that midrange budget. I considered V19 because V17 had great reviews (online as well as from friends) and V19 was just the natural successor.Performance 5/5. It's a very responsive device (meaning has good performance for day to day tasks and app switches). Dad plays multiple candy crush games at the same time and it is able to handle them just fine. Did not lag even once after weeks of usage.Screen is 4.3/5. No issues here. Very good screen. Not as awesome as flagship screens but that's to be expected. But most users, including my Dad, won't notice the difference at all!Camera is 3.8/5. I'm used to flagship device cameras so the camera on V19 felt underwhelming. It has quad cameras and all that but at the end of the day the photo quality is not the best. Since my dad uses the camera only occasionally, it is fine for him. Selfie camera is decent but main camera could've been better.Battery 5/5. Lasts more than a day for moderate usage. And very fast charging at 30W so that's great! That's Dad's key requirements so I'm quite happy with it.OS 4/5 There are some unnecessary softwares but you can just ignore those. The ""utility"" screen on the left of the main home screen is quite good! You can edit it to show only relevant stuff; by default it shows all kinds of things. The phone counts steps and calories, which is good to have but I am not sure if it does a very accurate job. The file manager and settings and other built in softwares are up to the mark. Phone calling is lacking however. It doesn't immediately show call history when I click on the Phone app, which is a bummer. Oh well...Overall - 4.5/5 I'm happy with the purchase. No obvious red flags. Ups and downs are to be expected at this price range. Even iPhones and other flagships have their own issues. Overall a great device for everyone (unless you want the best of the best and are willing to shell out the monies).I'll update this if some major issue comes up down the road. :)

I got a very good buy back for my redmi note 4, all in all i got a 9k approx discount with cashbk, or else i would not habe opted for this dum phoneComing to the user experienceIt's been two days that I've been using this phone and I I like the back cover which is very Shiny and classy the camera quality is nice and the battery backup and the recharge time is less than 2 hours to charge completely there are many e user experience when compared to Vivo with MI phones this phone is very very expensive for the price it should be somewhere about 20,000 and below there are many phones available in the market at the range of 20,000 and below and if you have a buyback phone I would recommend you to go for any other band rather than going for Vivo

( Haven't played high end games yet,)Battery life of 4500 is well enough and Charging of it takes very less time.Speaker volume is less as compare to Oppo F15, i  have .,Ambient light on sidebar is Attractive .Wireless charging is what i find i missing in this Price tag for Vivo V19 and a little bit speedier Chipset .Till now Satisfied and Enjoying it :-)

  Love it for -- Camera - alot of features, amazing Bokeh,wide angle, macro, alot of filters modes, night mode is simply fantastic, selfies are really amazing too with dual front AI selfie cameras. Miss video Bokeh though.-Battery - Lasts long enough and charges in no time. This is the best part. 33w charger-Face and in screen finger scanner is very effective accurate and super fast too- Fast - so far the phone hasn't ever hung or become slow.- OS is good , entertaining and full of animations, and all features that one can ask for. So u won't be bored. Also frequent updates are received.- Finish of this is too class and classy. The back part of the phone is gorilla glass 5 and looks and feels very premium.What I didn't like --not such a great processor at this price, however I don't really practically face any performance issues (not a gamer) but for this price Vivo cud offer way better.- price is on the higher side.- while the back panel is super premium with glass, the side panel is cheap black plastic. The cover given with it is rough on the edges and super tight to mount , so the panel got scratched the very first day while mounting the cover.- The screen is Super amoled however the colours don't feel as vibrant as a samsung(I used the m31 before) but this is just a personal choice.- For some reason I am receiving sms messages delayed (this affects me when I am to receive otp's) there was an update which has drastically reduced this issue, but it still exists. Never faced this issue with the same sum card on other phones.Hope this helped folks ! :-)

  It is a normal mid range suitable for 15 to 20k category. This phone makes little sense when you have Poco, Realme and even Samsung selling 30% lower and build quality at par and at times even superior to this phone. Oppo and Vivo desperately need to reasses their pricing strategies. May be considering the rivals are from the same parent company, the overall strategy might be to set a price range for every category to play on the minds  of consumers that they getting better products at lower prices. Otherwise nothing explains the price difference.

  I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance.by seeing quality features of camera I buy this mobile,and this worst product ever for camera .I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issuesFinget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 0
