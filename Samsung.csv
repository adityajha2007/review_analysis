    HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.

  I m not sure to call this a budget phone or a mid range phone. But worth the cost. Got it delivered as promised and seems to have good battery life. It's the 2nd day, I still have got 50% after watching few movies. If you have craze for the features and don't have money to buy a high end phone, then 31s is a better choice. The product is a little bulky than my MiA1. The display is just at it's best. Amoled. Phone doesn't seem to heat. But charging isn't in 97 mins as said. I find it to be around 110-120 mins just like normal phones. But the battery discharge is quite good. Found stock android to be a little flexible comparatively. But not to complaint. Overall it's one of the best phones I have ever had. Phone supports dual SIM + SD Card. Really Quality phone Made in India.

  The first Best part is wifi calling. Now you don't have to run to your balcony to catch some signals if you have a wifi connection.Second best part is that it has a very beautiful tag line - Made In India!Battery is literally a monster. No matter how heavy user you are. It will long last atleast a full day. For me it is 1.5 days.Screen quality is better than my iphone 7. Thanks to SAMOLED.Camera quality is again better than iphone 7. Thanks to 4 cameras.Processor is mediocre. Nothing great to boast about it. With this respect iphone 7 was smoother.Android vs IOS... once again ios is lot better than android.Overall happy with Samsung M31s4.5 out of 5 stars

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.

  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.

  I appreciate the camera quality of M31s.. the selfie camera has a quality as your rear camera and the night shots or shots in dark are much better. The rear camera has a nice focus though not able to take clear long distance shots (100mts) which are very far but shots within 20-30 meters are perfect.I was impressed by the performance and charging as well. I have a 6GB Ram as i'm not a gamer hence could not comment but else good battery life.

    Amazing Phone for the budget with One Glaring Flaw
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is just an amazing phone. The camera is really good, Samsung's OneUI is feature rich, but the display and battery are the real MVPs here. For such a huge battery, the phone doesn't feel that heavy, lighter than phones within this price range.But that's because they use glass, and Samsung uses a material which is basically plastic, and to be honest, I would pick plastic over glass anyday. Glass is glass and glass breaks. Besides there is no point in having a glass back if it doesn't have wireless charging as well right?Speaking about the camera, it is very similar to any mid-ranger, but the highlight I would say is Single Take. It is not only just fun to use, but is very helpful as well. I didn't expect to like it this much. It is amazing.Now the display, it's huge. And it's vibrant. It's just a pleasure to look at. Sure it may be 60Hz, but the sAMOLED panel is a cut above the rest.And the 6000mAh battery is coupled with a 25W fast charger, which charged the phone reasonably fast, about 80 minutes from 10% to 98%. This is definitely a two-day phone as I am a mid-weight user, primarily media consumption.The one glaring issue: THE PROCESSOR, and in extension the GPU. It is noticeably inferior to Snapdragon 720g, 730g and the 730 which you can find in phones of similar price range. The difference is not that apparent in daily usage, but I'm sure it will impact a lot if you scroll through media a lot, or if you game a lot. So if you're a gamer, I would suggest a Chinese OEM, they have better hardware for the price.In conclusion, if you are a media consumer who also uses the camera a lot, buy this phone without a doubt. If you are anything more - a gamer, a person who wants to future-proof their phone etc.. I would look elsewhere.I love this phone as this fits my usage perfectly.

    Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung.  Look of the mobile is elegant. The Amoled screen is very much vibrant and better than the previously launched M30s . Also i felt that the screen size is slightly 2 mm larger than M30s. The front camera is placed slightly 2mm lower than the top edge, henceforth may hinder video viewing in the enlarged screen mode. The battery is a monster with 6000 mAh , so need not worry about charging for atleast 2 days with respect to the way I use. Also thanks to reverse charging facility that samsung introduced in this model. Any gadget that has c-port can be charged directly with the charging cable provided as the both ends of the charging cable are of c- port. I think this feature is only introduced by Samsung in the budget range of less than 20k . However for connecting to the laptop I may have to use the M30s charge cable.  Also there is no heating problem during charging. Also the charging time is approx one and half hour from zero to full charge, which i believe is decent for a battery with capacity of about 6000 mAh.The sound quality is great. The camera quality - primary 64MP and front - 32 MP are awesome. There is a flash available for front cam as well similar to retina flash on iPhone 7 plus. Depth ( similar to portrait mode in iPhone) and Macro modes ( useful for capturing smaller size objects) are decent though not excellent. I am yet to check wide angle mode of camera. Also I am yet to check the night mode shots. Also there are other special features like single click are easy to use . It will capture a bunch of photos and video from which the best and required ones can be chosen and rest can be deleted. There are other features like single video recording on front and back cam , smart selfie option which I am yet to explore and review the quality as I just received the mobile . Also I liked the concept of introduction of finger print on the power  button on the right side. The specification of processor, RAM and storage space are decent for the price paid. Also i believe that samsung is offering the mobiles at the decent spec at lesser price when compared to other premium brands like one plus, MI etc.,. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the mobile within 5 days, i.e., a week earlier than the promised date as I see that the mobile is not available at the time of order placement, because of the demand. Earlier I bought 2 qty of M30s and I had a very good experience of using them as i never experienced any performance issues with them. Also the M series mobiles are quite sturdy. Now I believe that I will have a much better experience with M31s. Thanks to samsung for the continual launch of better quality mobiles at a very competitive price. Also the samsung galaxy eco system of apps and cloud are pretty decent . Also I have a good experience with the services of samsung incase of any damage to the mobile. Overall I am happy with the product and also with the services of samsung and Amazon.

  My issue:I purchased this mobile to play PubG or other games but play games on this mobile is now a dream because it's stucking during play and Amazon is not providing any return and replacement option while my return window is still open.Regarding Amazon service:This time amzon changed their policy, so only replacement option available, but you won't be able to replace it because if you are facing any issue then it's technical staff will not approve or accept it.Regarding Samsung:I tried samsun mobile device this time but this company haven't changed so far. They are showing super fast processor or ram but you won't be able to play any game like PubG or any other game, all games are stucking. I will not recommend samsung mobile, you can buy note 9 pro insted of these samsung mobiles.Conclusion before buying any product on Amazon please check they are providing return and replacement option, if they are providing only replacement option then Don't buy those products from Amazon because it's a trap.Don't waste your money on Amazon because they have proven that we should not buy any product online. Because after purchasing if you are facing any issue afterwords their support team will not help you to return it.Thia is just my review and chalanges that I'm facing with AmazonGod bless you guys.

  In one word the phone is awesome. U can go for it. I am writing this review after 3 months of usage.Pros:1. Battery life is awesome. It normally last more than a day in vast usage. I had got a maximum backup of 3 day with single charge at normal usage.2. 64 mp camera is just fantastic. Pictures are crisp and detailed. Even it will not haze with sufficient zoom. Night mode is much better then other phones.3. Look is also good with a punch hole camera. Samsung has maintained a premium look even after housing a 6000 mah battery. Phone looks slim.4. Display is much better even then premium Chinese smartphone. Super amoled as it is.5. Finger print sensor is much faster. Face lock is also very good.6. Speakers are loud and crisp. U will get clear, loud and detailed sound while calling and music/ videos playing.7. Gastric look also provide a premium look. (Even Glass back is desired as it becomes a standard now a days).8. Phone weight less with 6000 mah battery. It takes 1.5 hrs to completely charge. Thanks to 25 watts super fast charging from samsung.

  I bought this phone only the reason it have a best camera. But after 5 days use i am not satisfied with this phone. Reasons:-1. Camera:  It's not up to the mark. In low light photo is very bad.photo looks blur. In night also camera not good. Only v can take good photo in evening. That time all phones give us better photos.No AI support in camera. And portrait mode is in not in one click, its also not perfect. Macro also not good.2. Battery: The 6000 battery feels like 4500mah battery. One day we can use.3. Processer: now I don't feel any lag,but all youtube videos we can see this processor is not good enough for this phone.4. There is no second space option, No IR remote and gallery doest have discover,album options like iphone and honor phone.5. No screen recording option and no network speed showing option.Pros:1. In single shot we can get many videos and photos.2. Great display & design3. Smooth touch & fast fingerprint sensor.

    Best phone under 20K.. Stylish, Great Cams, Display & Battery... But y still Exynos Samsung.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Though not a big samsung fan I purchased Samsung M31S immediately after India launch yesterday for 18K after HDFC discount for 6/128GB after waiting for nearly 2 months for Redmi note 9 pro max 6/128 which was at 17K then went to 18.5K due to tax and production issues coz of lockdown. It was impossible to buy in their weekly flash sales coz Redmi didn’t have enough stock.Out of frustration thought of buying Samsung M31 6/128 which was available at 16K then but the Exynos processor, old dewdrop front cam, rear fingerprint scanner and 15watt charger for 6K battery holded me back…My Lenovo P2 which I had purchased on launch day in Jan 2017 had speaker issues after 3.5 years of usage.. Service centre has closed down in my city and nowhere else speaker was available…but after Redmi stock issues and M31 shortcomings made me purchase speaker for P2 from amazon and still using the phone. Repaired a phone for the first time in my life. Lenovo P2 is most underrated phone. Best battery life ever. Even after 3.5 years I still get 9 to 10 hrs of screen time. Excellent.I have used samsung only once earlier….Note 3 Neo….gud phone intially but later started hanging and pathetic battery life…. So my main expectation after using Lenovo P2s huge 5100mah battery from 3.5 yrs was battery life as I am a heavy user though I never play games.Though M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s gud for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues of battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super amoled display…..All these chinese brand phones though have gud Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super amoled display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super amoled display…..there is day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super amoled display and sony sensor…in samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power efficient and smooth for day today tasks and heavy multi tasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will atleast match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very gud especially the camera… excellent super amoled display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super amoled display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a gud successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100 it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is gud….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies r excellent provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like wat normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi tasking there is no delay at all….hope in long run it remains the same…I am still little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…

    Issues with device !
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Two issues detected :1. There is a considerable voice fluctuation in the RECEIVER of the device. While talking on call, the voice of person on another end fluctuates (decrease & increase frequently).2. The Single Take camera feature is not working properly. When I capture from Single Take, it only gives 3 videos but not the 7 photos along with that (which, it is not meant for).One could ignore the non working of camera feature once, but RECEIVER related issue can not be overlooked.When any new model is launched in the market, it is recommended to wait atleast 1-1.5 months from buying it, so that the detected bugs would be fixed by the company in the devices manufactured afterwards.I made a mistake, hope it helps others.

  My first ever Samsung phone...Feels like a premium phone when you hold it in your hand.Display is awesome. It is very bright even in outdoors.Weight of the phone is little bit more. But it didn't feel heavy, because Samsung has done its weight balance in pretty good manner.Processor is good, didn't feel any lag till now.Fingerprint scanner is a little bit slow. Sometimes it needs to press hard to scan.Camera quality is also good especially in daylight. But typical Super slow motion video(which I like most) is of limited duration.Battery last for 24-30 hrs for normal use (battery optimization could be better). The battery life can be improved by changing power mode in the setting.The 25W charger is also very good. And it is ""Made in India"".Samsung UI is also good.Samsung should have provided at least a case with this 20k phone. It is hard to find case in the market for a newly launched phone.Overall worth for the money. 4.5/5 star.Better than the Chinese phones.Do buy the Samsung phones instead of the cheap Chinese phones.

  After using 10 days:1. It's not look like 6000mah battery. Other brands phone in below 5000mah, can give more backup than this.2. Very bad wifi receiver. Not able to capture wifi signal properly. Same thing for reverse case means mobile hotspot. It's not able to transmit high range. Trust me if you think I am wrong, just make a comparison with you any old phone and see the difference.3. If both sim card are on, in 2nd sim you are getting call, after disconnecting call sometimes network is fluctuating. It's taking some time to stable.4. If you are dropping your phone to bed, some sound is coming. It seems sim tray is casing this noise.5. Lock or Finger print scanning button which is mounted in right side is making sound (tik tik) while pressing it. It's not smooth.Please check your phone and don't forget to add comments here wheather you are facing or not the same. I am waiting for all your inputs.

  So here you'll get my honest opinion about samsung M31s👇I just got this phone.I ordered this phone on first launch day from amazon.Question 1:- What do i think about this phone in this range?Answer:- This phone in this range is quite good but if you're a samsung lover or you boycott chinese product and don't want to buy a chinese phone like mi,realme.You can go for it.Question2:- What do you think about specifications in this range?Answer:- Specification what i like most is Display quality,good battery backup,fast charging,good camera and process is still being tested so keep in touch on telegram @guptajitalks .Question 3 :- Should i purchase this phone in this range?Answer:- Umm i'll suggest you to go for it if you're a samsung lover and your priority is batter backup,fast charging,video watching,camera then please go for it but if in the past you've used realme,or mi phone then don't purchase it because you'll miss some of their feature which is not available in this phone you need to install extra applications for them from play store or other source.Question 4:- Should i purchase Samsung M31 or M31s??Answer:- If your main priority is fast charging and you want to use a new updated fingure print sensor you can go for it otherwise everything is similar in this phone.Choose according to your budget.Question5 :- Does fingure print work fine?Answer:- Fingure print senson is working awesome.I was also getting hesitate but now i am feeling relax because it's working fine and smooth.Question 6 :- Anything else if you want to ask then text me on telegram @guptajitalksAnswer:- Will be updated soon😊I want to mention something:-👇👇👇Note:- 1.Camera,charging,display,cable,Video watching experience is awesome.Processor is still being tested.2.You'll miss some feature if you previously used mi or realme phone.You need to install extra app for it.

  Lets talk about the positives first:Design & Build - Compelling for this Price range. Fingerprint Magnet - AlertDisplay - Damn, This is the best.Software Experience - This is not a clean UI but I like this feature that Samsung almost took customization to the next level.Camera - Decent, Sony sensors does its job and Samsung's camera features is like a cherry on top.Multimedia Experience - This is what the phone is good at. Believe me it wont disappoint you either.Battery - Humongous. and Fast Charger is in the box. No need to worry about the battery backup.Cons:-Not major but noticeable.Weight :- You ll definitely feel it when used for a long period of time.Performance - This is not so good as the competition provides for this price range. You can notice it heavily while scrolling Twitter.  But everything is usable. Just a little bit of boost to the performance would have taken this phone to the next level.Phone gets little bit warm which is also noticeable. ( I don't know if only I have that issue)Overall - (Gamer boy, Performance Addict) - Just Ignore thisPeople like me those who could sacrifice that little performance for a good multimedia experience should definitely give it a try. And that display, you ll definitely fall in love with it.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Here's an honest review after a week's usage. Please take the time to read the pros and cons of this device. I'll start with the pros first.Pros:• The Samsung display never disappoints, very good colors.• The device is pretty smooth to use, there's no lag whilst browsing and using multiple apps in the background.• Sound output is decent for this price range.Cons :• The battery life, its supposed to last atleast a day and a half with this 6k mah battery, but i get only 10 hours of battery life with a normal usage such as WhatsApp, YouTube, music and browsing.• Finger print scanner is not upto the mark, since it's narrow and thin button, it doesn't recognise the print sometimes. I have thick fingers and maybe its because of that.• Face unlock is pathetic, I sometimes think that it's scanning someone else's face at times. Most of the time it never recognises my face eventhough I've registered my face in a bright environment. During low light, forget about it.• Notifications bug, when I play a WhatsApp audio or voice note, it constantly notifies me which is annoying. And whilst riding and listening to music, if there's a notification in the BG, after every song it notifies me which is annoying eventhough I turned off notification reminder.• Camera quality is decent but not great like how they've advertised. Some low light shots are grainy and only in bright environments it can capture some good pics.• No screen recording and no notification lights, although this can downloaded from the play store, there's an app for it. But the whole point is this is an android phone and its the basic feature, my previous cheap Chinese Huawei phone had more features.Anyway, overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're just looking for the battery life because it'll disappoint you. I'm quite disappointed with this phone and I doubt if I'd go for Samsung again. Thanks for reading, good day.

  The screen of the phone was broken when we received it. On calling the customer service, they can't replace the product since it's out of stock so we filed for a refund. The pickup agent denied picking up the product saying he needs a confirmation email first. When we called the customer support we were told that the pickup guy reported that the imei was mismatched which is why he didn't pickup but in reality he didn't even check imei. Since then we filed for a pickup 4 times and nobody has shown up to pick it up. Pathetic behaviour by the Bhopal logistics team.

A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.Cons:1. Although the charger is of 25W charger, it's taking 2hours to charge completely.. may be because of monster 6000mah battery.2. Side mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a con since i haven't used it before and it's bit difficult to use.3. Phone is slightly heavy but that's because of battery but weight balance is good.Finally, if you are a heavy user but not with heavy games and looking for a clean android experience other than MIUI , colour os etc which will have adware in the apps, this mobile is a perfect purchase for you.

  Honestly I rarely review on products. I expected a lot from Samsung Galaxy m series particularly from m31s. I purchased one m21 for my father, m31 for sister and m31s for my self on exchange of Oppo f9. I was very happy when I received m31s. But disappointed about the poor packaging. Still I manage my anxiety to taste the set. The handset is having absolute premium looks. Again the picture quality of captured photos disappointed me. Battery is unable to give feelings of 6000mah. Its like less than 4000mah. Network is comparatively weak. Followed the procedure for replacement. The technician asked to install Blancco app to run diagnostic. Then he asked me to go for battery calibration test which is a one day process. Again followed the process of replacement. The technician checked all things and at last told me that the replacement may not be possible for this m31s rather adviced me to go for refund process. The foolish technician rarely knew the process of exchange purchase. On my second attempt of replacement process I came to know that, the first technician registered my complain as the problem is in m21. How foolish. I have compared my m31s with another m31s purchased by my neighbor where I found my set as weaker one. IF REPLACEMENT DONE IN NEAR FUTURE BY AMAZON I WILL BE SATISFIED AND RATE IT AS 5STAR OTHERWISE I WILL WITHDRAW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND CLOSE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMAZON.

  good product under budget. Got it for 18K in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support.Super fast charger.Good camerasSide finger print sensor is very good.Stylish gradient design.Few things I personally didn't like:Build quality - seems very fragile.Too much of pre installed software by Samsung.No back cover included in the box.Phone looks very long (depends on personal choice).I am not a gamer.All in all best budget SUPER AMOLED mobile in this price range.

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highThough the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.Width is less, height is more.The width is less than my MotoG5s+ and hence it disturbs viewing experience e.g. when viewing a YouTube video in a vertical manner.Pros:The fingerprint reader integrated to the power button is nice (touch to open, press down to lock)Does not feel too heavyNice display.The camera is decent.25W charger better than 15W of the M31

  I liked the camera on M31s and I think it's the best camera on a phone under 20k. Apart from that samsung is making Chinese manufacturers sweat by slowly focusing on mid range mobile category so yeah we can expect great phones under low budget as well.  Only thing which I don't liked about this device is Exynos 9611 as it is an old processor & shows its age while gaming. Apart from that everything is ""monster"" 😁.

  Purchased it on sale day, received in 2 days. 5* for Amazon delivery & service. Samsung M31s 8GB 128GB is the best to buy product in around 20k with 6000mah battery & amoled display. Camera is far better than M31 as it used Sony sensor. Works like charm with no lag, beautiful display, good camera, easy too handle, not much of bloatware & many can be disabled/uninstalled of not needed. Overall a good to buy product. 1* less rated due to dual core back cover design, which is not of ok & not much impressive. Otherwise all good. Go for it.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Is this the best smartphone under 20,000/-Let's find outBattery:-This is the only reason why I bought this phone. So, I thought I will share my experience regarding the battery life of this phone first.I really use my phone.  I receive over a hundred phone calls per day and hundreds of WhatsApp message if not thousands. When I reach my phone I have an average of 50% juice left in the battery. So to say, I am pretty happy with the battery life on this phone.Camera:-This is another one of the main selling point on this phone.  This phone has quad camera setup at the back and an single punch hole display in the frontList of cameras at the back:-1. Primary camera - 64MP - Sony IMX6822. Ultra wide lens - 12MP - 123° field of view3. Macro lens - 5MP4. Live focus lens - 5MPPrimary camera takes beautiful crisp shots with excellent dynamic range provided ample amount of light. If doesn't disappoint me in night also! The ultra wide camera provides the same amount of color balance and dynamic range. The live focus provides good edge detection. So this is the most improved phone in the 'M' lineup of Samsung phones.Display:-This has a beautiful display with a dot nucth which doesn't interfere much. Therefore this has a good display tooFingerprint sensor:-This phone has a side mounted fingerprint sensor. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is excellent and I quite like it compares with my previous phones which has fingerprint sensor at the back, but one thing which disappoint me is that it won't work when you r hands have even the slightest amount of water or oil or any other thing.Conclusion:-This is not a perfect phone under 20,000/- but it is definitely one of the better phones for 20,000/-.

  A perfect phone made by Samsung in mid range. Camera perfect, Body style perfect, Battery perfect  & much more. But a thing I don't understand that why Samsung made charger cable C to C, it would better if it comes with USB to C which helps us to connect it easily with many devices like powe bank,  Desktop and etc.And one more thing I like to suggest to Samsung that, it will be more better if Samsung gives a back cover with every smartphone because in market back covers are available after 3-4 weeks of phone launch & all of us know that it is how risky to use a smartphone without cover.

On the other hand it went from 100 to 96% In 23 mins while playing You tube music on Speaker it was connected through Wi-fi, no SIM connection and No any apps in background.5. Processor is fast.

  The mobile was delivered on Aug 12, much before it was showing earlier. I was using MiMax2, a Chinese product and was happy to use that and had decided to patronise Mi in future. But with current concept of avoiding Chinese products altogether, I ordered Samsung M31s. Initially, it looked to be smaller that Mi max2, though both having 6.5 display. But later on realised that M31s is a bit longer that Mi max2 thus both the phones have the same square cm area!The mobile is fantastic in everything. The finger sensor at the power key on the side is comfortable, so is the face recognition; I am enjoying it. I have set all three, pattern, finger sensor and face recognition for opening it. I could easily install dual WhatsApp. Two sims with external memory card is appreciable, with Volte in both sims always on. Camera should be good; I do not use it much.I could not find a system of locking/unlocking individual app through finger sensor, as I was having in mi max2, nor a shortcut for using torch when in haste. Yet happy for discarding a Chinese mobile and substituting with a good one, Samsung M31s. Go for it.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Poor configuration mobile from Samsung ( Review after a month of use )Following are the reasons:1) They processor performs poorly causing the phone to hang all the time2) The screen touch sensitivity is poor and screen blanks out while making a  call. Need to double tap it every time to get the screen alive ( eg for a IVR call )3) Battery performance sub par.4) Too bulky and fat to use.5) Very poor sensitivity fingerprinter reader. For a left handed person makes  its use complicated due to positioning of the sensor.6) Camera is great quality but for Rs19,500 ie cost of phone I would rather buy a  DSLR camera to enjoy even better quality pics than get stuck with a phone  whose only ability is to click good photos. Remember a smartphones first and  primary use is to make phone calls and its smart use. Both which are sub par.My verdict ..... Please dont go purely on the star rating and reviews published on Amazon.Do your own research and decide.

  I was looking for a new phone in the Samsung brand I must say galaxy M31s is the best choice, that too at such a reasonable price.I have been using this phone for over a week now and following are my  views on the phone.1. Delivery by Amazon just the next day of my purchase. Thanks Amazon!2. The size of the phone is quite appropriate,it stays in my pocket easily and can be used single handed. It has a metal like finish3. As far as the display is concerned, crisp and clear with infinity- O display, absolutely soothing to the eyes.4. Sound quality - It has a premium quality Dolby sound and I just love to hear music on this phone.5. The 1st best feature if this phone is it's battery with 6000 mAh. Even if I don't charge my battery lasts for at least 2 days. Also the charger is very fast.6. The 2nd best feature is the camera. It has 4 cameras having best depth and clarity of 64mp with ultra wide lens and macro camera. The clarity of the front camera is outstanding for selfies!I would strongly recommend this phone, you can't get anything better in this range..

  Display is best in this segment. Its bright punchier colorsand great outdoor visibility. Deep blacks is perfect for movies. Sometimes i Miss high refresh rate screens but its ok to have such beautiful Amoled display.Camera is better now. Single take mode is fun to use. Night mode is now better than M31 and the best part is pro mode is back with shutter speed control. 4k front video is useful for bloggers like us. Selfie is good. The only thing i missed is telephoto camera. Syper steady is amazing.The exynos 7611 handles the phone quite well. But samsung should upgrade this to snapdragon or better processor made by samsung. UI is best much better than other phones. Its lag free and smooth. Everyday use is best on thisBattery is best best and best lasts more than 2 days with normal use and one day with heavy use. Screen on time is around 9 hours. And the best part is it has the same charger with Samsung provide with s20 series. So i can use my s20ultra with the same charger.Overall i can say its best in this segment if you dont need high refresh rate display but you want best battery life and beautiful vibrant display with better color accuracy then go for it

    Phone which will give you mixed reactions
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Overall this is a phone for non gamers, camera lovers and for media consumption. It has been a mixed reaction with 15 days usage. More details below. Thank you for reading.Pros;Display: 10/10 nothing more to say.Camera:Back cameras are really good with all four of them being useful in different conditions. Apart from the 64MP primary sony sensor the 12MP wide angle and 5MP macro sensor give good quality pics and not there as a gimmick.Front camera is a mixed bag. Under slightly low lighting conditions it doesnt produce great pics and is bit grainy. Samsung please fix this with an update. But if you put the screen flash details are good.Colors are saturated which some will like and others may hate.Network Reception and data:So far so good. However, it is not the fastest w.r.t data download speeds under this price category. It depends on the modem that has been used.Battery: At first the 6000mah battery seemed like a 4000mah w.r.t performance showing battery drain issues. You need to check the device health statistics to determine the culprits. If you have turned on adaptive brightness (auto brightness) then battery consumption will be high. Since smasung uses the front camera for auto brightness. I would suggest you to turn it off. Secondly add apps which you don't use frequently to sleep and deep sleep under battery optimization. Also switch on the adaptive battery optimization. After all this now it finally lasts longer in the range of 40 - 44 hours in a single charge. Again it can vary based on your usage. But these steps will definitely increase your battery life per charge.Cons:Processor: Samsung please use a nice processor in such a good mid range smartphone. This is a downer. Almost everything else is good. Gamers please stay away from this phone. Day to day task are fluid but still you may notice occasional lags while opening some apps and animationsGlasstic Back: If you use a cover on your phone this may not be a concern. However, people who like the phone as is...may not be able to use it without worrying about a scratch.Weight of phone: Along with a good cover this phone can build your biceps. You can feel the weight.Overall people who use a phone for connecting, productivity, social media, vlogging and media consumption then this is a good one. Gamers will hate this for sure.

    Major drawback -  Voice Call and Internet not working simultaneously
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  A major drawback which I found; when I'm on voice call, I can't connect to the internet...means you cannot send a photo on whattsapp while on voice call or cannot open chrome to check something...this was a major drawback on my previous phone also...but with today's advancement and latest phone, I did not expected this.....Being a businessman, very often I need to send photos on whatssapp while on call to discuss details at the same time....NOT POSSIBLE on Samsung M31s....rest all things are good at this price.

    Phone is dead in 15 days
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone has gone dead in 15 days and when we took it to the Samsung store, we were told that the motherboard is defective and needs to be replaced. The part is not available at the store and we are severely inconvenienced without a phone and having to visit the store during these Covid times. The phone cannot be replaced because the 14 day deadline is over, according to Samsung policy. This defect in a brand new phone is not our fault and we are very unhappy to get a defective and repaired phone in just a few days of using it. This is not expected from a reputed company like Samsung. Very upset. Would like this problem to be addressed urgently.

    An excellent phone but with some drawbacks
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am using the Galaxy M31s for a few days now. I will note the pros and cons as I have observed so far.Pros:1. The display is excellent. Vivid colors that pop, good contrast and definition.2. The touch response is butter smooth. I think it is at par with an iPhone.3. No lag, no heating issues, no screen problems so far.4. Battery life is very good.Cons:1. There is a huge amount of bloatware. I uninstalled most of them, but some cannot be uninstalled. I disabled or forced stopped them. I deleted 1 star because of bloatware.2. The side mounted finger print sensor is not very convenient. They should have given a normal real mounted FP, which is easier to use. I deducted another star because of side mounted FP.3. The face recognition feature does not work all the time, but that is a common issue across many other phones.

  Not as expected. Don't go for fast charging which is one of the slowest. Big battery has not made any difference. I was using phone which was using low battery but still used to get same usage time as i am getting on 31s. Charging takes more than double the time my earlier phone used to take. Photos looked OK. Finger print reader is absolute waste. Nothing more to tell as of now. Not at all worth for money. I waited and bought this as wanted to buy non Chinese, but completely disappointed. Adding - ctakes lot of time if charged from car charger. Even 1% increase takes hell lot of time. Other phones get charged 10 - 15% by thr time this phone charging increases by 1%.Don't know what to do. Samsung this is not good.

  Screen - screen quality is low as compare to A series mobile. A series mobile for retailes and M series for online shopping. You can confirm with any shopkeeper.Ui /processor - non chinese and clean UI. I am chinese user earlier switch to samsung this time. Being a normal user it is ok with current processor (youtubers saying processor bla bla bla).Only giving 3 star rating cause no screen guard and case is provided in the box. Which is still not availble in market as well.When you got the box... i observed box quality is quite low as comoare to other brands however no problem..this is ignorable..every companies looking for cost cutting.Phone is good if you are normal user watching media and social networking sites and small gamers.Gamers definitely need to go with realme, mi, other brands having high antunu scores

After the technician report confirming that the phone is a defect piece, the only option available was to place it for a refund as it is no longer in stock.

Deliverywas fast it came earlier  2 days. I'm  happy .also the charger has a feature  reversecharging  so if u want to transfer anything we need to buy separate  cable .I won't  play PUBG so I don't know for gamers but for normal games it runs smoothly. I'm  very Disappointed because they don't  provide any case so if u buy also add temperglass and case it's  my personal request so that u can enjoy ur mobile from the  first day onwards..Samsung team we r buying  mobile for 20000 y can't u afford headphone and case for customer.

  This is my worst experience with amazon that too over samsung.I got the mobile delivered on 20th Aug.Packaging was good.I opened the box overall style is good in view.But when i switched on the phone,it directly opens up in safe mode after restarting also it was in that mode only.Again down volume key button was not working at all.Then I find the phone detecting sim without sim card only.The phone was generating more heat as compared .I called to amazon tech support ,I followed all the instruction according to them still there is no change.I requested for replacement where I saw in my page phone is in stock but they denied for replacement and just the option was refund.

  Wifi signal reception is too week as compare to Mi mobiles. Battery gets discharged bit faster than Mi mobiles.HOTSPOT signal strength is weaker than Mi Note 5 Pro.I would say Samsung must use better hardware if selling these mobile more costlier than redmi and other Chinese brands who are giving better hardware in less cost.I would not suggest to buy this phone regriously.Within a month of use, it has started HANGING even on basic apps opening, processor is not capable to handle basic process and apps.. DISAPPOINTED from SAMSUNG again.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I ordered the phone as soon as it went on sale, i.e on the midnight of August 6. I was unaware that it would only be available to prime users so I had to first subscribe to Amazon prime, and during this process the blue variant of the phone that I wanted to buy went out of stock. Nonetheless, I managed to order the mirage black 6gb variant which was the only one available at around 12:25 am.But yeah I would say that I'm not at all unsatisfied with the black one as it looks so stunning. The phone was delivered to me on the morning of August 9, that is pretty fast.It has been 2 days since I'm using the phone and I would say that there is a lot about the phone to boast. I'm so happy to have been able to buy this.Everything about this phone is so awesome but the two outstanding features of this phone are its premium looks and the rear camera. The rear camera captures stunning images in all light conditions and the quality of videos is also amazing. I really loved the single shot feature, its fun to use. One thing that I'm a little bit disappointed with is the performance of the front camera in low light. The sAmoled display is so cool, you won't face any problem operating your phone in the sunlight.The 25W charger is quite useful as it charges the phone at a blazing speed. The 6000 mAh battery lasts longs but I haven't tried extreme gaming yet.So guys just go for it! Nothing can be better than the Samsung Galaxy M31s at this price range.

  Bought the device on the first day of its release. Have been using the same for more than a week now and below is the review of its real life performance:Pros:1. It has an amazing display. Samsung is an undeniable champion of amoled displays and this phone is not different in terms of its standards.2. The camera, both front and back, are an amazing tool to play with. The photos come out real sharp and detailed. The single take feature is very handy feature and will be a boon for any beginner who will be able to capture amazing moments with a single click.3. The performance is very snappy for daily use. It is not made for heavy gaming, however it will not disappoint for light gaming.4. The UI experience with the One UI is amazing and smooth.Cons:1. The placement of the fingerprint sensor on the power button and that can be tricky for some of the users to get used to with. 2. It is not supplied with cover and that is strange considering all the smartphones in the segment are supplied with one.Hope the review was helpful.Willl update the review if something noteworthy discovered while using the device.

  Battery life and camera quality is good but the Samsung chipset is still the old one and this can pass you off sometimes. Your phone will start handing as soon as you do multitasking . This happens even when you are not playing any games or even not using any heavy application.Also the camera quality is good but it is definitely not 64mega pixel.I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone.

Adobe Premiere rush, & few moreGorrila glass 3 is not that grat in terms of display protection, so installing a screen guard is a must, also the back is very proan to scratchesThe figer print sensor is good but not that fast like Xiaomi phones, also the face unlock misses so many times but thats also subjected to be fixed by updates.Overall its a good ""Samsung Phone"" if you dont run much graphic intence games or apps

  So after using the M31s for more than 3 weeks, I have a mixed feeling about the device.Things I love about the phone:1. Display2. Clean UI3. Looks good compared to other M seriesThinks which are just Ok:1. The camera is identical to the older M31 and thus is underperforming.2. The battery isn't that monstrous as they claim. Felt like 4000 mAh. But still takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to get fully charged.3. External speakers are better than other M series but aren't good as most mid-rangers.4. Dolby Atmos audio failed to meet expectations as it is only good for enhancing the treble (Great help if you are old).Thinks I hate:1. Bulky and heavy. Feels like some walkie-talkies that I used to have during my childhood!2. Poor performance for this price! Can't even play games like Asphalt 9 without lags and frame drops.3. No option for random wallpapers with the One UI 2.4. Face unlock is pretty slow and thus is an obsolete feature!5. A slippery and plasticky body which acts as dirt and fingerprint magnet. Back of the phone is now full of scratch.6. The phone rebooted by itself 15 times in 22 days which is something scary for me!7. Unable to feel that Samsung signature, I can't explain why but feels like those Chinese brands on hand.

The battery is amazing, even though I understand 6000mah is large I've not charged my phone in 2 whole days and still going at 50%; the ultra wide is better than I expected and the phone is light! No idea what phone these youtubers  were using but it fits well in my hand and is not heavy! I normally abhor exynos but I will say this is a tried and tested processor with no lag at all when I'm using the phone but noticeably not that snappy at pubg but not the end of the world! I'd very easily recommend this phone to friends and family. A+

    Who is Kamal??  Definitely cheap quality manufacturing at this price.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  For the first time when I turned the device on out of the box, the device was named as Kamal's Galaxy M31s. Now I dont know who that kamal is!!  Can any one tell me why it is named as Kamals and who that kamal is?  Themes also show as "" Themes recommended for kamal"".  This makes me feel like the device has been used by somebody else before and then remanufactured it and sent it to me.Device manufacturing is of very poor quality (not the mobile phone).  Looking at the box and its packaging, it does not look premium quality.  In fact, the package feels very cheap.  There was no back cover and screen guard provided at all in the box.  This definitely feels like it is manufactured by some local people not by the company like Samsung.  M series being specifically manufactured for India.  This shows how cheap the company sees at the Indians to give this kind of worst packaging and quality.  You can even check the printing on the sticker attached at the back of the mobile with imei numbers.  How cheap quality printing it was. (Check out the images. I even attached photos of my redmi box and u will make out the difference).Mobile phone definitely hangs sometimes.  I faced hanging issue while closing telegram app.  I also faced abrupt closure of apps in the middle on its own while installing all the necessary apps in the mobile.Camera wise, rear camera is good, but front camera is not up to the mark.  In low light conditions there is definitely a lot of noise in the photos taken with front camera.Display wise, it is Excellent being a superamoled display. However, they should have given 90Hz refresh rate for the price of mobile.I am not a gaming person so I dont know about gaming performance in this phone.I had high expectations  on this phone and purchased it with a huge excitement and enthusiasm, but this mobile does not meet the expectations and it disappointed me a little bit.I am somewhat a lover of samsung products especially display related products like mobiles and TV.  But, this time I am little disappointed with cheap manufacturing of the product.  Then again, display quality is very good. Other than that, rest of the things really disappointed me in this phone.

  The processor is pathetic, your phone would start lagging as soon as you start to use it. I had hoped that samsung one UI won't have many bugs but it has crucial bugs linked with speaker and mic that won't resolve after updates. Sound quality is okay for movies and stuff but pathetic for music. On top of that, Amazon won't accept returns and replacement is too much hassle. I'm used to buying literally everything online but that stops now. The only good thing with this phone are nice display and fingerprint and an average camera with bad camera app. If you can shell out a little more go for little higher end phones with better processor and never buy an Exynos

  Reviewing this after 48 hours of arrival..So far So good..Haven't experienced any lags..This Samsung One UI is so easy to use than redmi UI (IMO).Build Quality:It is glasstic material in back and our hands are Imprinted ..So better to buy a Back case as soon as possible..On the sides I think its made of metal ..Could have gone with a different material but front looks stunning with a broad screen and a bit curved (4/5)Camera:Gives its best in high lightning areas and indoor shots are good too ....Night Mode is absolutely beauty and the single take feature is woww (4.5/5)Battery:First of all charged it for 7 hours and it took approximately 1.15 hour to charge from 30 to 100%.After a moderate usage for about 36 hours it has a charge of 50%. (4.5/5).Sensor:The side ways fingerprint is new and it is quick enough..Face Unlock is quite a bit slow..(4/5).Overall:Since I am not a gamer i prefer this phone is worth buying and tried adobe Lr Mobile..It is easier to use and in the range of 20,000 with a good UI with a moderate processor ..This is preferred.. It also comes with Knox Security

    BATTERY NOT WORTH THE HYPE, OTHERWISE SUPERB PHONE
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  CONS1. Battery life not worth the hype. Drains very quickly. Paying 20k for 6000 mah battery and watching the battery percentage go down in front of your eyes so quickly feels very bad. Am normal user, use only and only WhatsApp for office work and calling yet battery drains faster than my 3 year-old Lenovo K8 Plus.2. Unboxing experience not good either. Very disappointing that back cover was not included in box.3. Dated processor shows its mark occasionally for example when searching for something in the native Settings app or launcher.4. Camera performance in absence of abundant light is deplorableNOTE: Am facing weird call drop issue in WhatsApp calls but not sure if it's phone's faultPROS1. Fingerprint and face unlock are both very fast2. Single Take feature is amazing3. Screen, form factor, design looks and feels greatTL;DROverall, if you don't expect TOO much from the battery, you're gonna love this phone. Best non-Chinese phone under 20k atm

  1. Fingerprint reader is very fast.2. Face unlock is a little slow though it can capture your face in a mid range dark room too.Disadvantage of the face unlock was once it cannot recognise your face it does not try again you'll have to use the fingerprint or password.3. Camera quality is amazing in the light but in the dark there's a little disturbance.4. The battery life is not that good as expected though they have advertised a lot about the battery being 6000mah. It's charges pretty fast.5. Reverse charging also works amazing though you cannot charge it to any phone which uses a B cable. Only C to C phones will work for this.6. A phone cover should have been provided with the amount taken. Plus its a little slippery so a phone cover is a must.Overall it's a good phone but these are a few pros and cons when buying the phone.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  If u r not interested in heavy gaming then can't get a better deal for a phone under 20k.Pros-1) Screen - there is no doubt Samsung does provide the best screen. U will notice that instantly,  and Super Amoled is really something if u r coming from ips led screen.2) Battery - Seriously what they advertise is real it really is a monster. Last from1.5 - 2 days depending on ur usage.3) Camera - This is the first time Samsung is using Sony sensor in there below 20k phone and boy can u tell the difference.  Sony sensor with Samsung image processing is just lit, hands down can't get better camera in this budget.4) Software- Being a past redmi and realme user i can tell how much software is important and oneui is very smooth with no blotwares or ads and works really well. I guess after oxygen os and stock Android,  one ui is right behind them.5) Design - This phone looks far better then it looks in images and overall weight balance is great , doesn't feel heavy at all even though having such a massive battery.Cons-1) No Knox security- Don't be confused by all the reviews u find online, there is no knox security included, idk why it shows secured by knox in boot menu but still there is no such thing. It is such a great and convenient thing I just wished they included it here atleast considering the price budget.2) Processor- It has the same exynos 9611 processor thats in their phone that cost around 11-12k . Come on Samsung why are u stuck on the same processor upgrade it there are several better option available.2) Build- It is a plastic body and is very slippery, so requires a cover ,which is not included in box.3) Screen around the front camera gets automatically and returns back to normal after sometimes, since it is a software bug I hope they fix it future updates , sometimes it stuck out and gets a little annoying.

  Bought this product after selling my Poco X2 due to battery issues. The phone is good but can not match Xiaomi or Redmi phones when compared to options available for customisation like dual app for all and not just WhatsApp fb, dual space, ainbuilt app lock, schedule battery saver,etc. I'm missing all those features in my M31s and the fingerprint sensor socks because it operates on it's own unlike Poco X2 where we had option of unlocking phone by pressing the sensor. So no accidental touches. Moreover the face unlock is also OK and does not work everytime.But nonetheless, I have to live with it now. So please weigh pros and cons before buying anything.

    Best Media Consumption phone
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  So, it has been few days since I got my hands on Samsung Galaxy M31s, and I've got to say if you like media consumption on phone this is the best. Let me divide this into pros and cons.A. Pros  1. AWESOME DISPLAYI mean it when I say this has got an awesome display. The infinity-O sAmolled display is perfect for media consumption. Sure it has not got that high refresh rate that some Chinese phone makers and high end phones are providing, but the qualtiy of the display, is top notch. (Also like some infinity o displays out there this doesn't have any beading or halo effect around the camera cutout) 2. SINGLE TAKE IS SUPERBYou have to use this feature to get to know how good it is to have it on a phone. There are time when we want to capture a moment both in videos and photos (maybe with some filters) This feature let's you have that. It automatically captures the best photos and videos with just one shot. It's not as good as that in Samsung's flagship phones (just because they can capture using various lens and m31s uses its primary 64MP lens) 3. MONSTER BATTERY LIFEWell that's to be expected right? 6000mah should last you a full day with heavy load (like heavy gaming and media consumption) I had 15-20% remaining battery with heavy use. But mostly with semi-heavy gaming and usage the phone lasted me almost 2 days without charge. 4. WELL OPTIMISED PHONEM31s has android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box and it's a well optimised for apps and games. I have not faced any stutter or lag while using apps or playing games like pubg and codm. 5. 25W Super fast chargeSamsung provides with the flagship typec-type c Samsung 25W super charger inside the box. Thus it takes relatively less time to charge the huge 6000 mah battery. 6. Non-Chinese phoneSince boycott Chinese products is going on and most of the smartphone are made in China, this is a phone which is made in India so a good alternative.B. Cons 1. Plastic buildSince it's a plastic back it easily picks up scratches. So I recommend to use a case or a skin on this phone. (Case does not come with phone so you will have to purchase it)Well I don't have any more cons that I can think of. Yes it would have been good if Samsung upgraded the processor, but one UI 2 is well optimised for this particular processor so maybe that's why they didn't upgrade the processor.Basically M31s has a good screen, battery life, awesome camera, good fingerprint reader and is a excellent Samsung phone.

  Big thumbs up for this mobile. Looks great. Only draw back is battery not performing like 6000 mah. Hardly one full day with full battery. Everything else is perfect 5 star.Finger print sensor is lightening quick.UI experience is niceCamera is top notchI feel UI needs few more customizations within ONE UI itself. Case and screen guard should have included in the box. Battery size 6000 mah is eaten up by Exynos processor makes this phone battery offset. No advantage of having 6000 mah battery.I think this is going to be the last phone with these many features in sub 20k range. M51 is going to be sub 30k range for sure.Got this phone with exchange and it's a good deal

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  though price great higher than m31 and most specs are similar to the its predecessor, I will prefer M31s to buy as it may sound more future proof. First the things i don't like and i know i am writing cons part first as besides it con part it is actually best phone with everything top notch in its real time usage.* Its processor, in day to day usage didn't find major lags or hang thanks to the great software optimisation with one UI through heavy usage and fast multi tasking might get difficult and i also notice it take more than usual time to power on.* i don't consider it as a con but it is heavy though weight balance is so good that you don't feel it is 200g+ phone* and last one , its about buying a 20k phone ans still not getting a phone case, screen protection and earphones is disappointing to be honest. for initial protection you need these things.* overall couldn't find more negative. i mean there are few small thing but i consider it as personal preference so no complain.some pros-* Its design and its build quality is top notch in the price range of 20k thanks to the added frame and back design.* Its camera department , display is the best* fingerprint scanner is fast though it is parallel to the frame you may need time to use to it.* it is waste actually waste of time to write positives and everything asides cons are great .to be honest i am completly satisfy with this phoneand last thing i prefer 6gb and 128gb varient as it is more value for money . OVERALL A BIG THUMPS UP.

You will need to buy a back case to avoid this.

  The best phone Samsung has ever made in this price segment.1.Display makes this phone to compete with the high end flagships.2.Sony sensor is really an add back to this phone since it takes excellent pictures in daylight especially.3.Most reviewers had commented on the processor part that it is not a gaming one but my experience with this phone was different, tried PubG with ultra setting which worked very smooth and lag free.4. Battery perfomance is other thing which stands out and it last me 1.5 days with single charge.5. Fingerprint and Face unlock are insanely fast.The only drawback was samsung could have added a back cover and Screenguard with the box but what I did was ordered the cover along with the mobile.Overall I will rate 4.5/5 for this phone because this really adds a premium feel and experience.Hope this helps!

Inspire of fast charger it takes enough time to charge to 100% due to its large size 6000mAh.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is good.Some software related issues are there which can be solved via an OTA update.Operating system Samsung one UI2.0 is good but missing many features like screen recording etc.Overall a very good deal during this independence Day sale.Of course I get a good exchange value for my one old mobile.If you are not a gamer definitely it's worth to buy.Major problem is its wireless Bluetooth connectivity, auto connect and disconnect frequently, Samsung fix this.

  List of things that I noticed after using for 7days-1. Battery :- As per the mentioned specs the phone got a  massive 6000mah battery 🔋 but as per my usage it lasts hardly for a day ( I didn't try any game and mostly used  for stuff like taking online class ,watching YouTube videos and listening music) but the charger compensates it. It took 2 to 2: 20 hrs to fully charge( depends on condition )2. Camera:-The thing that disappointed me the most is the camera quality of the phone especially the front camera. The front camera is 32mp but the quality of camera is not as good as the no says . It cannot compete with with Chinese co. like Oppo and Vivo in terms of camera. During night even at decent lighting condition the photo it clicks appears to be blurry.White balancing of the photos is not accurate.Live focus is unable to clearly detect the edges of the photos.I previously had Vivo v15 having 32mp 1.5 yrs older whose camera quality is far better from this device which arrived later than that.3. Dark mode is awesome that at night we even cannot distinct the edges of phone and the screen.I loved it4.Design:- Design of this device is 👍 👌5. Sound quality is decent6 Processor: Samsung should have provided better chipset than this.7.While I was taking class on Unacademy within 20mins it got heat up.8.Screen:- Screen is awesome,the s-amoled screen produces awesome colors and the viewing experience is great on this deviceHope samsung fixes the list of problems  I mentioned especially the camera capture during night through the next update

  Camera : too good.

Almost 5 hrs of SOT on medium brightness n mixed use of media, browsing/shopping wifi.Screen: Its samsung. I don't need to say anymore.No lag of any kind seen since. The only cons i felt r the phone is on heavier side, exynos processor( u'll consider only if u Need to play pubg like graphic intense games on topmost settings)  and may be the fingerprintScanner position, fr some. I got used to it in a day but took my mom 3 days now she's ok with it.

  It's an absolutely fluid machine. Awesome sensors at the right place. Just wondering if Samsung would make profit by selling this phone at this price. I am sure they are limited quantity and would be taken off soon. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and responds with diligence. The great feature is its power-packed camera which not only has extremely powerful lenses, but blended with lossless software to encode it. Battery survives for 2 days, with extensive use for calling and listening to music. I am a lisztomaniac, so you may imagine. Thanks. Very contended.

Camera is good, i hope it will improve with updates.I hate bloatware. I purchased 8Gb RAM version, but out of 8 gb, only half is available, it is irritating some times. I observed a bit of lag while playing mine craft. So, I must say that processor can be improved.Overall, good phone, considering non-chinese brand.

  Overall good  experience, my rating would be 3.5.Pros:1. Size : Good for movie & gaming.2. Camera : Very good, works exceptionally good in night mode.3. Look and feel : Vivid, typical samsung type.4. Pre- installed softwares: Limited and only required ones. good from security aspect.5. Weight : Feels heavy and when in pocket will definitely make u a feel that u are carrying something worth not losing.Cons:1. Phone heats up if used continuously for 30 mins for phone calls.2. Even video calls and you tube playbacks heats the phone near camera area. Pretty unexpected from an highend phone from Samsung3. Battery: Not a good performance as per 6000 mah. LAsts for a day with normal usage, i.e. phone calls, whatsapp, 1 hour youtube video, and some browsing. To be honest, i am disappointed on battery performance looking at its size especially when Samsung made it a big USP.4. Crux: You have better options in this price range, would recommend to try those instead of blowing 21,500 on this phone.5. Processor: Samsung has not done any big changes in its old Exynios Genre.Must go ahead..But Samsung has been a miser..did not provide  rear silicon cover.Charging cable length is just OK IN length.

So while playing no issue.Screen refresh rate: it's a myth 90 hrtz is better compared to 60, hidden fact is your eyes are only detecting 30 frames/hrtz, so your eyes are not even usung 60 hrtz frequency.Weight: yes it's slightly heavy bit do not hurt while typing or gaming, weight is well balanced.Protection: No comments, I always cover my mobile with screen gauard and back cover,  looks and sturdyness are also fine for me.

  I was Samsung S Duos user long back in 2012/13 and that experience was pathetic. I had decided, I'd never buy Samsung again and I didn't till this M31 (other model) was launched which my brother is using. After hearing its reviews, I finally decided to break my oath and give it a shot. I purchased M31s because it was recently launched and bit higher version. Got decent exchange value for my old phone. While purchasing, I compared it with Redmi Note 9 pro max which had less battery and IPS display.Since this phone had AMOLED display, it looks pretty good. Build quality is also good.However, I am disappointed with the battery as it drains fast compared to my old phone which I exchanged. If you are heavy user (the one who plays lot of gaming, HD videos etc.) which I am not, still the battery goes for 24 hours max for this new phone which was same as my old phone which I used for 2 and half years. I wonder, how many times I'd be charging it after a year or something. Also, finger print is embedded in the lock button itself. Unfortunately, it gives lesser area to scan your finger and takes lot of time to unlock. Only 3 fingers can be added.So, if you want a phone which is not Made in China and good brand, built quality, then go for it. If you are heavy gamer or watch videos constantly, then think again. I am giving 4 stars because of the battery issue only and I could get it well within 15k.

I didn't know is the problem is in my device only or if the device is like that onlyI strongly not recommended you to buy this phone because its not able to handel the load of online classes then if you are a heavy user how will it survive in heavy usageAnd please don't trust on youtube reviews of this smartphone they are totally fake.And yaa its camera too its camera in low light condition is more useless then the sit of an dog

  Happy to switch to samsung phones from all other chinese phones i owned previously.Samsung has inbuilt device care app which manages the ram and saves battery and puts apps to sleep when not required. You also get samsung max premium VPN service for free although you will have to select the premium service from samsung max app bcz by default basic service is selected for everyone. Kindly note bcz the VPN is free its slow. Comes with Dolby atmos feature but ya dolby atmos can only be used with headphones and works with Bluetooth headphones too. What I liked about samsung is the dolby atmos feature provided is not there for show it really works amazing when you listen to real dolby atmos content using headphones on the phone . For me I am satisfied with this phone

  Pros: -In hand feeling is great with unique gradient look.-The cameras of this one is just amazing. Photography might become ur hobby with the ultimate quad camera setup in this device.- Fingerprint sensor is modern and works really well.- Super amoled display and the speakers with punchy sound gives a completely different experience with the multimedia.-25 watts charger is the cherry on the cake.Cons:-A back cover could have been provided because the back is a fingerprint magnet.- A bit advanced processor could have made this phone an asset worth possessing (Only for hard core gamers).Conclusion- Being a moderate user, I am really happy with this Samsung device. It's a big competition to any other smartphones in this range in the market at this point of time.

  Aesthetics :First of all the phone is very good to look at. The glossy finish on the back of the phone where the colours merge looks good. The one down side is back side of the phone is a finger print magnet and be ready to invest in a good back cover for the phone. It would be good if samsung provides a good cover in the package for the phone as they are providing for some models in the m series.Camera:The phone has good camera on paper and lives up to its expectations in the real world. in well lit scenario it provides very good results. The low light scenario is really challenging even for the top of the line phones. This phone is also no exception in low light scenario I see a bit of noise and loss of detail.Battery Backup:The big thing about the phone is the battery and it is able to hold the battery for two and half days of normal usage.Software Updates:One thing I remain skeptical is how long samsung will provide software updates, I think it is for 2 years but I would be happy if get for 3 to 4 years.Conclusion:So, if you are looking for a good phone under Rs.20000 this is a phone that will and should be in the first three places in your list of phones.

  It's not about giving review, it's about sharing my experiences with someone who need to buy this from hard earned money. I don't share my mobile picture because its my whole thing now.Why you have to buy this?1. Mobile look is awesome.2. Performance is really good, behind my expectation.3. Side finger print sensor is working than what you think, meanwhile faceunlock also working soo good.4. Battery stands upto 14hrs rough use, but I'm not try it more than twice.5. Edge to Edge perfection in screen looks and handy to use.6. Don't worry about price because Samsung 25W get know you it's perfect.7. UI 2.1 gives you different experience.8. PUBG is really working equal to other competitors.So why you should not buy this1. If you want a 5G network don't think about this mobile.2. Signal strength is not improved like other M series mobile, I feel its have to look by samsung.3. Battery save mode ( Medium power saving) not perfect as I seen before.4. Faceunlock consumes more battery.Don't confuse by review if you want a mobile classy, good performance and updated trend choose this because it has everything. Expect 5G.

  Feels good to hold. It is a plastic body but still seems quite premium.The camera is good. Not a flagship so  ant expect much. But a lot better than my  previous samsung s8. The single take feature is a load of c**p. Or maybe I haven't used it efficiently yet.Battery backup is simply awesome. Don't.  Have to keep plugging in. But again the 25w fast charging is a load of c**p. My previous moto g6 had 18w turbo charger and that worked a lot better. Though that battery capacity was low as well. But gave me equivalent backup.Screen is the best part. It's beautiful, huge and crisp with minimal pinhole obstruction. Good colour saturation and brightness. Face unlock is just a tad bit slow. Fingerprint sensor is a bit of an issue. New position at the side on the unlock switch but more importantly it is not the most responsive

  Simply brilliant! I definitely think this is the best phone to buy if one has the budget of about 20K. The battery is long lasting, the cameras are better than any other phone in its category and the screen is magnificent.The only little glitch is the fingerprint scanner on the left of the phone. It can be really uncomfortable for people with small fingers. And it isn't as responsive as it should be. I had to press at least  twice to unlock the phone. Maybe I am a bit too casual with my touch, but its definitely an issue.However, besides the above minor issue, I think this is a brillphone by Samsung for people who want to have a good viewing experience,  a great set of cameras and a long lasting battery.

  All good. Comes preloaded with some 3rd party softwares, that was a bit irritating but all can be uninstalled. Great value for money though. Battery lasts full 24 hrs with heavy bluetooth usage with my earbuds and wireless ON all the time. Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge completely. It has Knox security but remember, it's not water proof so be cautious in rain and near pools, tanks, bathroom, etc. Feeling on screen is good. Great with multiple apps open at the same time. Do not forget to put TPU cover or armor guard with some screen guard. My friend dropped his 2 days old M31s from half a meter height and screen is shattered and gone black completely.  I think original screen replacement from the authorised service center is 8.5k. Better safe than sorry. Worth every penny for this price. I bought in prime day sale so got 1500/- additional discount.

I never had a samsung in my life, so I thought of giving it a try but this is a completely useless phone. There is nothing user friendly about it. The only good thing is the battery life. Most of my apps hang. I always have to force stop the apps to make them work. I completely hate this phone. If there was a minus rating, i would have given that. If you still decide to buy it, trust me you'll regret later.

  To begin with the phone is a complete package. Display gives an amazing experience, no doubt it's a battery monster coupled with 25 watt fast charging, reverse charging offers a great advantage, rear cameras give the best shots in the price segment, they add great variety also, front camera is good, the auto wide angle selfie feature is really handy, but sharpness can be improved. Single take is fun to use. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is really quick. It has Knox security but it's limited as it doesn't have secure folders and other A series features. Though made of plastic it still has a premium look and feel unlike the previous M series phones. Single mono bottom firing speaker is adequately loud but sounds a bit tinny at times. Dolby Atmos is present only for headsets and the music output is excellent. Processor is not made for gaming, hardcore gamers stay away. It's smooth and breezy for day today tasks. Multi tasking is no issue. OneUI 2.1 has excellent improvements over the previous versions. Call quality, network reception is absolutely fine. Internet download and upload speeds are quite satisfactory. Overall it's a great experience. Loved it

    Buy it for its Camera and Battery!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Samsung has been giving the best amoled displays for quite some time now. This phone keeps up with the tradition. There is No 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate so yes that can be an argument as competition offers that.But then Samsung display is Samsung display. You just can't get wrong with it when it comes to watching videos.M Series is known for its battery, and the M31s delivers a punch here. Also, despite a beefy battery, phones ergonomics are pretty well handled and overall grip is comfortable (but sligthly heavy) thanks to back end curves.Phone looks and feels beautiful and the polycarbonate material build quality feels good but I don't intend to test it. Back is a finger print magnet.The Exynos 9611 SOC is good enough for less power hungry games but there is frame lag in certain games which demand graphics. Overall with 6000 mAh battery, a better optimization by 9611 SOC might have led to more than 2 day life, but no one is complaining.Call quality and reception is pretty good.Okay, the best part is Camera! Somehow Samsung has managed to fit a very very decent camera in to this one. Yes colors can be over saturated (5/10 times) but it's the same with most phones these days as perhaps the general public likes punchy colors.Video recording is pretty fine tooBut the winner here is the Night mode. Don't know what got into Samsung's head and they have accidently incorporated a very improved night mode for a M-series phone (less noise and better field of exposure). Its easily the best night mode in under 20,000/- category of phones.Even the 12 MP ultra-wide takes better pictures than other ultra-wides in daylight.Overall a good solid phone. Samsung is always guilty of over pricing (may be their screen costs more or whatever), but still would attract many. A price of 18000/- may just have killed the competition, but may be not this time.Disclaimer:I'm a very casual gamer, mostly see movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime video and so display and battery are my priority and the M31s doesn't disappoint here.Clear advantage is the camera, specially it's Night Mode.The 9611 SoC handles my daily routine well and 6GB RAM eases multi-tasking problems for the SoC. So didn't notice any lag in my experience so far.Min storage is 128 GB, and I really never needed more. You can always use a micro SD card to futher add storage.The review is based on my usage and i feel most of the crowd uses phone for social networking, web browsing and occassional gaming, so any basic SoC can handle it fine.

  First the delivery from Amazon.  Delivered within 24 hours of order, amazing!Used the phone for a week, my observations -Display - 5/5 Amoled display is brilliantBattery & Charger - 5/5  Lasts for 2 days and charging is pretty quick.Software -  4/5 Samsung's software overlay is quirky, would have preferred something closer to stock Android.Touch response - 4/5  Quite smooth and fast but could be better.  This phone needs a 90 Hz rate.Camera - 5/5  Overall the photography is very good.  The single take feature is helpful.Fingerprint sensor - 5/5 Very fast and button location is convenient.  Haven't tried face unlock.Overall appearance -  Looks quite premium even though the back is plastic,fairly bulky and heavy but very comfortable to hold and use.  Would suggest a good back case.  This is not a phone for those lookin for a sleek and stylish mobile.I am not a into gaming so cannot comment about the performance in that area.  However, going by its overall performance and speed, I am sure it will perform adequately.Conclusion, a premium product at a slightly premium price for a mid-ranger.  Comes without a back case or screen guard, unlike most other phones in the market, surprising that Samsung is cutting corners in such a small thing!!

  Another well desinged model from Samsung M seriece with high capacity battery. Android 10 + Dark Mode best combination for Samsung display to viewPros-Design & Display The design of the mobile is awesome with 6.5 Inch Super Amoled Full HD display. Big screen to watch movies. The pixels resolution and smoothness of the screen is damn good. Nobody can beat Samsung in terms of dispaly. Glassy finishing at back side is too good. Edges and screen ratio is fine. Classy look. UI is awesome- Storage 6GB/8GB RAM is definitely huge, helpful for gamers, mutli purpose users. I didnt see any lagging or hanging till now while using. 128GB storage is lot to store-Battery Battery life is good. Lasting 24hours after more use, still 30% or 35% power will be remained.-Charger The charger cable is coming with Type C at both sides. Very fast charging 25W.  Reverse charge is provided in this model which is good option to lend some charging to others (Can use M31S as a powerbank :P)-Camera Came with new feature Single Take which helps you to capture realtime photos and video at the same time (Slow motion video, Fast Forward video, edited photos). Camera clearity is good and decent, Macro, Live Focus options will bring the creative photographer in you, but when I compared with Mi Cam I feel Mi cam sharpness is better-Processor Coming with Exynos 9611 processor. Works really fast and good without lagging.Cons- Since the size is big little bit difficulut to operate with single hand, but now a days it's not a big issue- Fingerprint scanner is not very accuarate, sometimes you may feel disgusting to unlock, even face lock also slow in response sometimes. Can be improved- Sound Quality is good but volume is not much- No indicator for notifications- Unncessary preinstalled Samsung apps- Ads on the screenPrice could have been set 18k as there is no much difference between M31 and M31S in terms of battery, processor, camera (Except Single Take). Must buy for Samsung Lovers

  Lets talk about the cons first.. the front camera struggles in low light, due to the charging cable being type c to type c.. one cannot use it as a data cable which is a little annoying. There is no TPU case or screen guard applied with the phone which makes the phone little more vulnerable and so we have to spend some extra bucks to get to that security.Pros are more than cons. The rear camera is really impressive, night mode too adds to its advantages, the front camera works like magic in good lighting condition. If we turn off the skin smoothness and beauty mode, it produces some good details. Battery life and the charging time is decent. Display is extraordinary. Sound is rich and loud. Don't worry about the processor, if you are not a gamer who streams and plays for hours, it is a perfect phone for you. It works lovely . Moreover it comes with Knox security.

  This is just an ok product. I ""will not recommend"" it at this price. Only reason I bought this phone was because I did not want to buy a Chinese Phone.The performance of this phone is worse than a Chinese Phone.Only good thing is it's screen size and display.The phone isn't very fast to respond. It hangs frequently. Everytime I unlock this phone the application which is already open does not work.I have to close the app and open it again.The fingerprint sensor on the side button also requires getting used to. It locks often as we hold the phone in our hand as it starts recognising anything on the sensor as our fingerprints which fail to match.If you don't save all the WhatsApp images to your gallery by default, there is no option to save it manually. Such a pain.Google Chrome also won't update no matter what.

    Galaxy M31s Don't buy the phone
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The overall experience with the Galaxy M31s is great. I like the overall features of the phone specially the feather touch on the screen. For those who are looking for a battery life its a huge disappointment.Two major disappointments:1. Since the phone is new in the market, Samsung should have provided a better experience with One UI 2.5 or 3.0. But there seems to be no plans for the UI upgrade.2. I am a heavy user and the only reason for buying the phone was the massive 6000mah battery. But it seems to be a pretty much disappointment from Samsung. I have been using the phone for a week now and the battery does not perform as expected. I don't play games on the phone but daily uses like Paytm, google pay, Teams, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp. The battery does not long even for 8-9 hours. I am sure that it is a paid promotion from the vloggers that they mention about the 2-day battery life. I was expecting the phone to be charged every 2 days, but I have to charge the phone every day. If I want to have a 2-day battery then I have to use very cautiously like not using wifi, WhatsApp, or any sort of heavy use.

  It is a very nice phone. Loved the always-on display. It's a very large and good display. I am playing casual games. The sound is loud. The battery life is good and fast charging helps to fill it quickly. There was no breakage for me on the Bluetooth front, I am pairing my Sony XM3 with this and I am not an audiophile but Dolby Atmos makes a nice hearing experience for me (XM3 is not Atmos-certified). The camera is also good enough for me (it has Sony cameras). I am not a pro photographer and ultimately all my photos are uploaded to google, so good enough camera for me. So it is a very nice purchase for me. And I hope every person buying this phone (instead of buying Chinese brands) have the same experience. Also do always buy insurance for your phone for at least the first year. I have seen many cases when it comes handy coz you never know when an accident (only to your phone) happens.

    substitute to Redmi note series phones but not really match them
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Using it since last 3 days and nothing significant  o complain other than fingerprint sensor. I guess this is little pricey compared to China phones  especially  comparing to MI Redmi note series which are are almost 40% cheaper and slightly better. Nevertheless I purchased Samsung believing they have stringent quality  checks compared to Chinese.Cons:1) Fingerprint sensor located on the side is annoying since it is tricky to unlock when used with a TPU back case. I would have appreciated if the sensor was on rear instead which would have been very convenient  compared to side to use. Don't use any case if you want the fingerprint  sensor to be less annoying  or choose the ones having sensor only in the rear or indisplay..2) setting  up this phone Initially is very annoying  and consumes lit of time. God knows what updates it is updating in the background which seem i could not find3) Little pricey compared to MI redmi note series phones,  I was using redmi note7s  prior to this phone. The hardware is more or less comparable to MI redmi series phones which are available at much cheaper prices...I purchased Samsung and just avoided the temptation of Chinese  phones in respect to boycott..otherwise they are pocket friendly. Hope samsung reads this review and refund me and bring down the prices a little bit as wellPros:1) Samsung brand, assume completely made in india...not sure how many chinee components  are used though2) display and battery3) decent camera4) does not over heat during normal use

  After a span of 8 years I purchased a Samsung brand. My last brand was Samsung grand. During this 8 years all my phones were Chinese brands between Mi and Huwei. I was looking for a replacement for my wife's Mi Max2  and zeroed in for Samsung M31s  which I purchased through exchange offer during the festival sale offerWhat I liked about the phone1. The phone looks much premium than the other M series phone.2. Great Camera with decent camera software3. Decent battery life and fast charging4. One UI gives an amazing experience.5.  Super Amoled screen for which Samsung is famous forWhat I dont like about the phone1. Processor lacks fire power when there is heavy Multitasking2. Poly carbonate body lacks the premium feel of metal body3. Due to battery size the phone feels heavy and feels more when back cover is fitted.Conclusion: If you looking for a phone with premium camera  good looks and decent screen quality but ready to sacrifice  processor  firepower other than Chinese brand Samsung M31s  is definitely a good buy.

No lags or heating for day to day usage.25 watt charger. Reverse charging.Phone is not very heavy.Cons:Phone costs around 20000. Samsung should provide features like Samsung Pass in this phone.Panel is made of plastic. It get scratches very easily. One has to apply back cover to avoid this.No water resistant rating provided or mentioned.M30, M30s, M31, M31s all have same processor i.e.  Exynos 9611, which is based on 10nm. On other hand many cheaper phones are using 8nm processors which is more efficient. Samsung is charging good amount of money for some incremental changes.

  This is my 3rd Samsung Mobile. I was a big fan of Xaomi Redmi Mobiles, had 4 of them; I still am a fan, except for some performance issues, quality and other worrying issues with security, as its Chinese. Don't know when the updates stop as Xaomi stopped updates of its UI year after year for some 2-3 year old models too.Lately after purchasing Samsung Tab.. I am once again wooed and wowed by Samsung Quality & performance.Its SECURITY & PERFORMANCE that landed me here with M31S. I have no complains except for screenshot feature which is easy in Redmi & little cumbersome in Samsung, yet a 5* for everything from Samsung.  I admit and say that this M31S has a bundle of features to explore. The camera is very very impressive and pro mode is simply exquisite.

  Very bad expirience with Samsung as a company, I am a doctor who is dependant upon mobile so my patients can contact me at any hour. I had xiomi note Pro 7 working fine, due to china border problem ( being patriot) I decided to spend 20000 rs on samsung M31s and I did. On 26 th night sometimes my phone went blank,I came to know when my emergency covid patients relative  came knocking on my door at 4 am accusing me of putting off my phone which I did not do, Samsung m31s did. After working tirelessly for 25 yrs and even in pandemic I was accused of being careless thanks to Samsung. I have lost my patient reports, was not reachable, went to service station exposing myself to 20 people as Samsung has no social responsibility of maintaining social distancing in 80 Square foot space.I am throwing all my samsung things and will not ever buy anything from Samsung anymore and I advise everyone the same.Thanking youDr Sameer

  Samsung Galaxy M31s is the latest offering from Samsung India in the M series of smartphones. Samsung Galaxy M31s is an excellent smartphone and will highly appeal to all Samsung fans in India. With an excellent camera setup which has many intelligent features, the camera enthusiasts will simply love this phone. The only thing that should have been upgraded by Samsung in this phone is the processor which should have been more powerful. The 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant costs ₹19,499 and the 8GB RAM with 128GB storage variant will cost ₹21,499. All in all, this phone is still highly recommended.

   Really Samsung , I never knew Samsung has stooped to this level of mobile manufacturing . What kind of quality check you guys have. This is an over hyped phone with lots and lots of quality issues. First of all , screen freeze, open any app, leave it phone for a few seconds and try to interact on it , screen is frozen . You have to literally tap the hamburger menu to resume all the apps.  What kind of testing your quality team did ?  And 8 GB Ram , its just a number on the paper and coming to the great Exynos processor .Not sure what this processor does . My Redmi Note 5 which is  2+ years old phone that has 4 GB runs pretty smooth and lag free with out any lag.  I chose Samsung because , I don't want to fall into the trap. of Chinese products again. But you guys proved it is not worth . Need to again go for another phone since , you guys even after replace I got the same phone with the same issue and the screen freeze is cried out loudly in Samsung forums and Samsung forum moderators are sleeping. Never again Samsung.

  Relieved that going through those countless reviews paid off. Almost bought M31 but then did not like the low light pictures from M31. As soon as i read M31s had a primary 64MP sony IMX682 sensor, knew my search was over.Pros:1. Camera quality exceptional, very impressed with low light and night shots.2. 6000mah battery lasts almost 2 days with decent usage. Dont need to fret about plugging in every night.3. Clean UI, very limited bloatware4. 1 year complete protection at very nominal priceCons:1. Side fingerprint sensor is too narrow for my male fingers. Could never open lock in one attempt. Very frustrating. Samsung should have gone with traditional finger print sensor placements at back or front. I guess on screen sensor is too much to ask at this price.2. Screen freeze, after unlocking screen if you were browsing or reading, have frequently observed scroll to freeze. Unless i press return or minimize window, scroll dosent start to work. Very surprised to see such major software glitch, hope samsung solves this in future software updates.All in all its a good package. I could over come the cons as for me pros out weight cons.  M31s launch had perfect timing for me as i was looking for a under 20k phone with decent battery, scpecs and an awesome camera. Non-chinese brand was a cherry on top.

  One of the best phones I have ever used.This is my first Samsung phone, and I think I'm going to be with this brand for longer time.The most amazing part of the phone is the Camera. The Camera quality is simply amazing. User interface is also very user friendly. It's truly value for money phone. I would have given 5/5 stars but I reduced 1 star because of following problems.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't identify and we have to use PIN.Also, Battery life is excellent, but charging fully takes approximately 3 hours which is too long considering 6000 mah.I would also suggest Samsung to come up with brighter and flamboyant colours especially for India to beat the competition for longer time.

  First and foremost this is a non-Chinese brand phone.Display:With Super amoled display u can ditch ur tv and enjoy the tv like experience in Samsung M31s. The blue filter option can protect ur eyes while viewing in low light.Camera:The best till now. U can stop carrying ur DSLR henceforth if u have Samsung M31s.Single take is a good option in camera where you can capture the best moments and it gives best photos, videos and boomerang.Macro lens option is another plus point to capture the tiny things.In daylight the picture u get out of 64 mp camera is the best.Other best ones in camera are slow motion, hyperlapse, wide angle camera and lot more are there to explore here.Battery:No need to carry a powerbank if you have Samsung M31s. With one time charging you can do browsing, watching movies, playing music, clicking pictures etc. all these in a day and still battery will have another 25% charge.Fingerprint reader is very quick.After 1 month usage of this phone, my recommendation is just buy this phone.

  I have used it for 4 days and i feel for the price,  its a wonderful device . Even though you will get a mobile with better specs from Chinese manufacturers in the same price range  but thats the trade off you need to bare if u want a non Chinese phone keeping  in mind the privacy and data of users .Let us look into the pros of this device- 6.5 inch s amoled screen  is dope , colors are too vibrant . I think this is the selling point of this device.-battery is 6000 mah and coupled with 25 w fast charger its insane . It takes little more than 2 hours to fully charge and lasts more than a day .- samsung UI is refined and comes with many features  .- camera is too good ,you will get clear and vibrant pics .- side mounted finger print scanner is ergonomically  placed.Few cons which I have noticed are- processor is weak , they should have upgraded it for the hardware they are providing  .- its good for day to day usage , works pretty fine but not for heavy gaming- although phone is not slippery but they should  have included a cover with the device .

Looks is good, light weight, good camera, great display. Battery drains bit faser considering it has 6000 mah battery and S Amoled screen, expect this to be resolved in future updates. If you love photography, specially pro mode then go for it, it has impeccable pro mode the iso works the same way as dslr. See the shot attached. You will hardly find any noise. Low shutter speed with tripod give you amazing result. I love this phone because of its camera.

    The most problematic and unreliable series from Samsung, the 'M' series
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I was very happy with my purchase, because I found this phone after doing a lot of research on the Internet comapring a lot of mid range phones. The 'M' series provide very very promising specs at their price points and even Samsung's own 'A' series starts at a price point ₹10000 higher for a similar specs phone in the 'M' series.What went wrong is that my phone's touchscreen went unresponsive on it's own about 7-8 after the phone arrived and i couldn't get a replacement from Amazon because of their ''7days'' return poilcy. And surprisingly I couldn't even get a replacement from the official several Samsung service centres, because they prompted me that ""The M series phones are malfunctioning quite a lot and replacement parts for this series is not being supplied by Samsung "". So i decided to get a refund coupon that could sadly be applied at ""Samsung Brand Offline Stores"" only!. So I ended up purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite as an upgrade, because the Samsung 'A' series line-up is just so stupid, having the same specs as 'M' series and being ₹10000 costlier.

For Camera Geeks, you have a plethora of features out there!•On Performance, it's snappy in day to day usage. Though not 90Hz, its touch response is smooth and it adds to performance!********Cons********•Graphic intensive Games like PUBG might lag!I've played PUBG, it performs smoothly upto 1hrs or when you play in Solo/Duo/TDM, But when you play with Squad, phone heats up a bit after 30 mins, lags & shows stutters on prolonged gaming!In simple, its for those who chill out with friends & not serious gamers!•Other cons: No major issues noticed, Will edit when I see one!*******Verdict********Who should buy?•It's perfect for those who then owned a 2yr old Mid-range/Budget Device or 1yr old Budget device! Someone who've used flagship earlier will be disappointed!•For those who don't game everyday•For those who want Camera ready phone giving best pictures!•For those who watch a lot of content, it might be a Mid-range device but a Flagship in Display!

  Writing this review after few weeks of usage:Pros:1) Display: Probably one of the best display in this price range. Outdoor visibility is good, display is bright and vivid.2) Battery life: It truely lives up the hype of its battery. It's monster battery easily gets you a day with heavy usage and continuous usage and few time on gaming.3)Performance: The overall performance is excellent for day to day usage. Handles routine multitasking with ease. So far I haven't tried any heavy end games but I'm preety sure it can handle it with ease. Samsung is giving regular updates to make UI work smoothly.4) Camera quality: It is it's strength as well as bit of weakness. Overall general photography is good. You get a good color reproducibility in day light with Standard camera. In wide angle mode, image quality decrease and image tends to be over saturated at times. Night mode is okiesh but not great in extreme low light conditions. Selfi camera does great job for selfies and also for group selfies. Samsung has added lots of features in camera app to overshadow the shortcomings of camera in this phone. 64MP is just a number, don't fall for it. Regular 16MP mode shoots photos mostly upto the mark of most of the people. Overall Camera is not the best but above average for this price range.5) Fingerprint reader: Well it's fun to use. It's very precise and haven't been able to fool it yet, so feeling relaxed 😜. But accidentally you tend to unlock the phone though you don't want to. But with routine usage, you'll learn how to avoid it.Cons:1) Weight: With this huge battery inside it, the phone weighs heavy. If someone has habit of putting it in upper pocket of shirt, it will be difficult for day to day handling.Overall, it's more than a value for money phone and a definate upgrade over M31. Go grab one for yourself.

  It is only  non Chinese brand. Other than not value for money.Fingerprint reader works well.Battery life is good enough.Camera quality is not comparable with my very old phone Gionee Elife E8(2015) and Nokia N8(2010). It is laggy and not delivered sharp photos as my old Phone. So I have to wait for Google Pixel 4a. Samsung Galaxy M31s actually made for modern girls(slim design and beauty cam). I am not a gamer nor so much app user. But I've noticed this mobile is laggy. In every time when I open Google Photos in my high speed wifi, it takes much time than my 5 years old gione elife e8(3gb ram). Who have this mobile they will agree with me. Because my mobile (Samsung Galaxy M31s) is not defective, it is OK condition.  But it has limited capability and capacity which is not worthy for this price segment.

  I rarely write reviews unless the product is extremely good or worse. In this case it is extremely bad. The huge money paid for the product the ROI is very less . I got carried away from the reviews online and most of them were fake and looked like paid reviews . Let me honestly tell you the reasons for 1 star1. Poor camera quality  - especially the selfie camera . when we take a pic and try to zoom little we can see grains for every pic. my old mobile with lesser configuration captured better images .2. Extremely heavy and bulky . to hold the mobile for long time your hands will pain . it is like holding stone for long time.3. Hang issue - if you keep the app open for some time and when it gets auto locked if we try to unlock continue using that app nothing works.4. Too many junk apps - There are way too many default apps which are not at all goood and some we cannot even unisntall5. Default Apps - The call and sms apps are completely useless and had to make them non-default6. The finger print and face recognition - both of them are not good and many times i have to swipe or enter the pin even when there is enough light and hands are clean and dry. I never had this issue in my old mobile which had only finger print recognition .7. Many other options are not good and need to install different apps and it is a nightmare to configure all of it .8. I don't give much marks to battery too as it drains out often even though it is 6000 . no use at all. charging it daily . I don't play any games or keep watching videos all the day and neither I have any battery consuming apps.Overall a BAD decision to buy Samsung galaxy m31s and not at all value for money

  First and foremost I am not a gamer. I play zero games on my mobile phone.So this phone was to replace my Honor 6X as the battery started bulging. This phone battery lasts me for 2 days full for my use of calls, browsing, social media, music, videos and some piano. And occasional photography and videoThe Samsung one UI is great, even though it took me some time to get used to it.Camera is great. I have not yet fully explored the features but from what I have used the pictures have come out good. Some more edit features like frames could have been good in the stock version but that is good.The speech and voice clarity is very good. I think my old phone had only 70% of what Samsung offers. Dual VoLTE works great and could switch seamlessly. Interface is smooth. Did not face lags of any sort while multi tasking.Does not heat up while charging using the default charger in the box. Charges up to full capacity in like hour and 20 minutes.Good buy if you are a user like me.

    A Great Budget Deal...
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have been using this phone for a month now (6gb ram, 64gb rom variant) and here is my review:1. Build: The build is entirely plastic but does not feel cheap in hand. The gradient design at the back makes it real cool.2. Screen: The screen is one of the brightest and vivid. The colors come out really well and don’t  make the phone appear as a budget phone anytime. The media viewing is actually awesome.3. Battery: I take around 50-60 calls in a day; watch media for 2-3 hours. The battery lasts me the entire day (8am-9pm) and then I have to put it on charge again with 20% battery still remaining. The charger provided is 25w which takes almost 1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.4. Camera: The cameras are really good, especially the output from the primary on the rear one. The pictures are bright with good details in daylight. I also find the night mode to be better than most other phones at this budget. The selfie snapper is 32 mp with good images in daylight; the images appear soft and grainy in low light however.5. Software and performance: This is where the lag comes into play. The device is powered by a age-old exynos processor. I have felt stutters while using apps like youtube and whatsapp. When I minimise the youtube window and again go back to reopen it, sometimes I get only the audio with no video playing. Similarly sometimes whatsapp freezes while I try to take a picture. However, I think these are minor issues and can be fixed through software updates. All other apps run well. I am not a heavy gamer but games like subway surfers, ninja warrior run without any lags.6. Network and call: I have noticed many call drops and voice issues. The 4g connectivity is also not very stable (I use airtel). These again can be addressed through software updates.Overall it is a great budget phone with few software issues. This is the phone for you if you are on a budget of less than 20,000 bucks and a light to moderate user.

  The Exynos 9611 processor in this phone doesn't affect its performance experience in-person. You'll barely notice any performance lags in day to day tasks. Don't stick to spec sheet comparisons, you'll barely notice the difference in performance while using it side by side with other phones. It is a very solid and beautiful phone. Full charge in 1 Hr 45 min which is quite fast considering 6000 mAh battery. The screen is beautiful and cameras are great.'About phone' section shows it has Knox security but I don't understand why it doesn't have a secure folder option and any other option. Knox is there but I am confused about its purpose.Also, UI is scaled down and doesn't have a 3 finger gesture screenshot, no screen recorder, no edge lighting, and no Gcam support. Other than that everything is superb especially no bloatware and ads, unlike Chinese counterparts. Also, it has very good privacy control options. Also no issues in call reception and signal.

  I like the phone for a lot of things considering the price point it falls in. I use samsung S10 as my second phone and despite a bit bulkier than that because of the battery size, I like the touch sensitivity, the screen quality and crispness of the display and the touch sensitivity despite applying a screen guard.The battery lasts almost 1.5 days and the phone does not tend to hang. I use it as my office phone and Light gaming, so the screen real estate makes it easier to use the phone. I also would say that samsung has done a commendable job with the software, UI and there are a host of useful features similar to the high end S Series.... I find the earpiece sound to be quite loud and the speaker to be 3.5 on 5.You can go ahead and buy this phone if you are looking for a budget device that satisfies most of your requirements.

  Not at all happy with this phone from a reputed company. On the 10th day after purchase, I had kept it for charging in night and in the morning saw the screen to be blank and unresponsive. Took it to the service centre and they said the screen has broken due to fall. I felt that it was on the bedside table and may have fallen due to my movement in my sleep so asked them to repair it. The service personnel said that it is a new launch so parts are not available and he doesn't know how long it will take. I have still left it at the service centre and it's been a week, haven't heard from them.Most surprising thing is that Samsung says it has Corning gorilla glass 3 and Corning claims it to be scratch and drop resistant. But if thephone fell in my sleep from the bedside table which is 22 inches high and screen broke then all claims are false. It even had a screen guard installed. My several other phones have fallen many times but never broke. I will never ever buy a samsung phone again.Others should also think before investing their hard earned money in these times.

With the ppi over 400 the quality of the display is absolutely fantastic. For media consumers this is a gift and the massive battery combined you can go on and on watching your favourite shows on this beautiful display.Coming to the charger it is 25 Watt and it comes IN-THE-BOX which is GREAT!The charger will take the massive 6000 mah battery from 0 to 100 in about 1 hour and 50 mins which is great and enough for most of the people and the back-up you get from it is good too.Overall:Great phone for daily use and content consumption with great display and great battery life.If you are looking for a phone for gaming I wouldn't recommend this. But otherwise you can just buy this phone with no doubts what so ever!!

  It is the best M series smart phone till now by samsung. The camera quality is awesome(both front and back), expecially i liked the micro 5MP camera. (Attached sample shots )Other camera features like ONESHOT is quite amazing and gives a premier feel. Overall camera quality is very good having the sony sensons. The amoled display by samsung is fantastic. Figerprint scanner is quiet responsive but it could have been a bit faster. And the last thing is the Huge Battery with long batterg life. For moderate use the battery last for around 1.5-2 days, which is amazing. For heavy users it last for a day.Very Satisfied and Happy with the product. And one of the best in Price.

  Purchased it as a gift for my wife. Looks, build and performance is excellent. I myself have  S10+  but  comparing the price ranges of both these Samsung Models, Galaxy M31S is a better choice. Its battery is still showing 25 % even after 72 hours ( moderate use )  where as S10 lasts only 24 hours.  Delivered much before the expected date.  Earphones , not included in the package is disappointing.  Fast charger is great. Biometric scanner on side home button is not convenient. NFC is also a miss. Cameras are excellent .Overall a  five star deal. Thanks Amazon.PS Please take care while buying covers for this model. People are selling  M31/M31s covers As compatible  but there is size difference of .1 inch in these two models.

    Huge Disappointment!!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I purchased this phone going by the rave reviews but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The selfie camera is just okay. Haven't been able to test the rear camera that much due to the pandemic situation. Phone is slow and hangs when using multiple apps and switching between them. It also hangs when you turn off the screen while using an app and then turn it back on. Sometimes one has to click several times on action items to get a response. Fingerprint scanner takes an entire second for thumbs. I ran all the benchmark tests and this phone fared very poorly for it's price bracket. I had Redmi Note 7 Pro before this and even that fared significantly better. All I can say is that it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade for me. Battery backup is good though, as is the display.

    new features on Samsung M 31S
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  After going through specifications and youtube videos of many brands of mobiles (i let off all chinese makes) I zeroed on Samsung M31s. I had to wait a month as it sold like hot cake on launch day. Now that I have got it in my hand, I am really happy. It has 64 mp camera, 6000 mah battery and it charges so fast with new C charger at 25 w. It is handy and not to much weight. It has wireless calling facility too. One thing which gave me tension was the low audio volume of incoming calls. Suddenly i started worrying about my hearing capability. Then went through the settings and found that the default volume was kept for under 30 years old. May be the mobile took me to be one below 30 years and I am happy about that too. But my  Ears were not happy. Then Eureka !  I found here is a facility to personalise the audio volume too. This I am posting because  in  many  elderly persons face  with this hearing problem.Cons-------The  inward audio is kept on top but sometimes give trouble particularly when you have mobile  back cover. Same way face recognition is not very successful.

But it is way more secure than other android phones from different brands.Value for money - 9/10.Overall - 9/10, if you are not into gaming and would like a phone which does absolutely well in other aspects, then this is the phone for you.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The screen went black on 16th September, i.e. after about one month's use. Samsung Service Centre initially said that there is some software issue. Later on they said that the mother board needs to be replaced and they don't know how long it would take. The matter was taken up with Samsung and nothing has been done so far. After six days, the repair status on their website says that the service order is cancelled because warranty papers have not been received by them, which is absolutely rubbish because their Service Centre accepted the phone only after verifying the warranty details. Absolutely third rate service and phone by Samsung.

When I refused he cancelled the visit stating customer not available.Called Amazon again booked another appointment with technician after two days i.e for 18th Aug. Phone was checked technician approved the replacement.Called Amazon for replacement, they refused as the product was not available, i waited for more 2-3 days still it was not available.Then I requested for refund, they were ready to give, refund request was processed. Date - 23rd Aug.Pick up was scheduled the very next day, delivery guy came to pick up the phone . He refused the pickup as the phone was in dead condition.( Amazon service team did not inform them the phone was dead) understandable.Scheduled another pickup my calling Amazon stating the same problem.

    BEST BUDGET PHONE EVER
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is the BEST BUDGET PHONE samsung has ever made. i wanted to add a photo of the phone but after using the phone, I don't feel like taking pictures with other phones.To start with, when I did the unboxing, I felt like I was holding a premium device the minute I took it out of the box. To be honest, It feels more premium than ₹80k phone. Here's my take on the phone....Biggest Improvements -1. The camera (64MP) is flawless and capture details with amazing contrast. Intellicam feature is just AWESOME.2. The side mounted fingerprint sensor. It is the faster than many flagship phones I have ever used.3. The Punch-Hole camera (infinity-o) Display. It is just BEAUTIFUL.4. 4k video support. Just love it.5. The battery (6,000 mAh) get me going for 2 days without charging.6. 25 watt (type c to type c) charger is included in the box and fully charges my phone (0-100) in 1h15m. Perfect !!7. The AMOLED screen is the biggest highlight. Plus Samsung makes the perfect displays.8. Expandable Storage upto 1 TB plus dual sim slots. Highly user friendly.9. Selfie camera (32mp) is very very very sharp.10. Other amazing features like, latest software, scheduled dark mode, scheduled blue light filter, etc make it the best buy ever.Biggest Downside-NONEMy SuggestionSTOP THINKING AND BUY IT RIGHT AWAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL.Hope this helps.

  It worked well for the first 15 days, then problems start to come up, the phone automatically switches off, hangs for 5-10 minutes. I've bought this phone from my savings having my faith on Samsung that the phone will last long and will not hang. But, everything has happened already, I've taken the phone to the official service centre of Samsung, they just ignored me for a week and they had the phone with them for a weeks. They handed over the phone saying it's ok now, and the same day everything happens as it was before. I again have them the phone for 2 more times, nothing happened. All the Samsung service centre (official) did was ignore and no customer support.I've planned for buying galaxy s series in this Amazon festival sale. But I will never buy any Samsung phone ever and I suggest everyone for the same.At the end I lost the money I spent and my phone too.

The face unlock is too slow and makes you swipe, what's the point of face unlock if I have to swipe at the end? Avg sound quality. Lot of unwanted bloatware added that you cannot uninstall or disable, one more disadvantage over stock Android. I would not recommend the phone, rather go for Nokia or some other brand

    Awesome phone, but some problems
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is actually nice. But nothing is perfect after all.1. The camera quality is amazing. But the screen starts to flicker when we try to use the slow motion video feature.2. Battery life is fine. If you keep the mobile data switched on all day till you sleep, the battery drains which should not happen easily as it is said be of 6000mah.3. The main problem is that the vibration feature doesn't turn off. It doesn't have any option to turn off vibration for messages.4. Operating system is good. Not faced any problem till now.5. The samsung keyboard should be upgraded a bit. It is easy to type on Google keyboard but not on this keyboard.So in my opinion, this cannot be a ""MUST"" buy but surely a good buy.

  If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.

  I was using Samsung Galaxy M30 - 6 GB-128 GB - 5000 mAH - Tri Camera - 13 MP for not more than a year. I replaced it with Samsung Galaxy M31s - 8 GB - 128 GB - 6000 mAH - Quad Camera - 64 MP AND I literary found no any difference in both.1. The 4th camera - Micro Lens - is totally useless. It is not at all a micro lens. It gives the same results as close shot by any other lens.2. The 5000mAH battery of  M30 was better than 6000 mAH battery of M31s. I was getting M30 backup till night 9 - 9.30 pm and now I can get backup till 7 pm with same usage.3. The ram again is not make much difference. I doubt Samsung really has using the given configuration and improved the design.Finally, it was my WRONG decision to go for M31s. It is useless.

  This smartphone is  awesome!! I have had it for about 18 days and it is great!!Here's  a detailed review:Build Quality- Although  the material  is glastic , the whole gradient look is quite awesome and almost seems to be metal . A little tip though, invest in a good clear back - cover if you don't want to  get your fingerprints  all over it.Camera - The 64 MP rear camera is great !! It captures every single detail beautifully.The ultra-wide lens is far better than several others in the same price range and has near to none curvature of field .Macro-camera is simply phenomenal!! You can 'see' the 5MP in all the details. It could even capture the pollen grains on the inside of a flower!!The night mode is works like magic !! It transforms photos at dusk to photos of a jovial afternoon. And the Single take ! It's  perfect for capturing one - time occasions like Birthdays.Display- It's Samsung people!! You know the display is going to be the best !! The punch hole camera really does make quite the difference from M31.Fingerprint Sensor- Instantaneous!! And the position is optimum. After a while, it almost becomes instinct.Battery- Monster!! Absolute monster !! It can power through 2 days of mild usage and 25 W fast charging..I don't  even have to plug it in for a hour to get it from 20% - 100 %!!Software and Performance - Neat. It's seamless. The One Ui 2.1 feels great. I have to say .. In the set-up it does try to install a great deal of apps but still other than that, I see no problem.  Some of Samsung's Own apps are great..I have run several games at once on this thing but still , not a lag.Verdict- Go for it !! If your looking for a phone under 20k , this is the best  you'll  find . The display, the battery, the camera everything feels perfect .

  The camera quality simply superb and battery backup is better. The performance was comparably better with other models. My suggestion is good to buy.All aspects of the phone are on par or above the next segment.The display is gorgeous.Lookwise, it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.However, it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (Got reverse charging as well).The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use the A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side-mounted fp scanner.

  Amazing phone with outstanding battery .  Really a monster phone as advertised by Samsung . I have been a iPhone user and just thought of trying something not very expensive from Samsung stable and bought this phone on Amazon and this has not disappointed me even a little bit .Using Samsung M31S for last 3 weeks and can vouch that its quite a decent phone for those who want a large display , long lasting battery , lot of internal storage , super fast & reverse charging .Just a small manufacturing defect - small rubber protruding from back cover but that was not related to performance so can say overall a very good phone at a decent price .

Samsung is not providing ear phones, screen guard or cover case.3. Charger is having C3 connection, so charger cable is having C3 pin for both the sides. so you can use cable for reverse charging with other devices but we can't use same cable to connect with USB or power bank.4. Even it is 6GB RAM the mobile is not so quick to respond.5. 6000mah battery for new mobile  it is coming 1 day if we use data continuously.6. But good thing is single take photo option.

  Everything about the phone is just perfect.Camera is great, even in low light it captures light well. Even My OnePlus 6 does not capture that amount of light in night mode.Battery life is really good. Only thing is it takes time to get it 100% charged, but that's again because of 6k battery size.Looks are just awesome, the screen is dynamic and feels premium. Colors are vibrant as well.Sound quality is good, it does have Atmos. I still have to explore that option, but I hope it delivers good sound.The side finger scanner responds slightly slower if you have used some other high end mobiles. But I think it's is not something which will slow down the performance.Watching 4k videos is just amazing. You will love it.Overall I would say, it's much premium feel and does the job well. I am using OnePlus 6 as well, but really happy with this M31S phoneJust go for it

I thought its in my phone only so I ordered a replacement from Amazon, they did it without any issue. but new phone has same issue.-Weight is much more to hold it for long in hands. :(Things I like- - Monster shot - Amazing- Screen resolution and quality display is commendable.- In this price, there is everything that others 'good brands' are delivering almost at double.Lets see how it goes.... :)

  I got this phone less than one month ago. It does not have any protection from water.the phone was accidentally dropped in less than half feet of shallow water and was removed within seconds.But the display stopped working.The samsung service centre in hyderabad checked it and said that a charge chip which connects display is gone.But the irony is that part is not available at samsung service centres in Hyderabad. I am calling up all the samsung service centres in hyderabad but couldn't get the spare part. Waiting for the service centres to get the parts in a week or so.  This clearly shows how delicate the phone is and most importantly samsung has not made available the required spare parts to its service centres. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for an early miracle.

And once in everyday to unlock the mobile, it asks the security password.Battery life:-Battery life is awesome.I saw one or two movies daily.And I use camera for video recording for youtube channel. Sometimes for 2 hours continuously but the battery percentage drop is just 20 to 30%.And I play games in Mx player daily.And I use phone for normal use like calls, internet browsing, reading books, and watching youtube videos.But I used to I charge only once a day even.And for charging it takes nearly 2 hours.Camera quality:-And comes to camera quality I upload some images taken by samsung m31s. You can see it. And for video recording for youtube videos i use open camera app because in camera app given by samsung i didn't find exposure lock. So thats why I use open camera app.And if you want to see the video quality, check this link https://youtu.be/W0encosL-gUAnd while video recording morethan 1.5 to 2 hours. Phone gets heat lightly at the backside. But after stop video recording within few minutes the heat lasts away.Overall performance:-And coming to overall performance, this mobile is good. Good sound, good battery life, good display.Problems that I face:-1. While reading pdf or using samsung notes app and some other apps, I leave the mobile aside, its locked. After when i unlock the mobile, the app didn't interact for my touches like swiping, or tap to write something. At that time when go to recent apps menu and again click on app from the recent app menu. Again the app works.2. Just today, I have a notification from google play about tez shot game. And while I playing that game I face some frame drops but I don't know thats the mobile problem or app problem.3. And comes to sound quality. It was good but almost sound comes in between the volume levels of 4 to 10. When I place at level 4. The sound was too low and cant able to hear. And while changing volume level at one level the sound drops much.Finally I am totally satisfied with this mobile and I love this mobile. Because it satisfying all my needs like good camera, big battery, amoled display, side mounted fingerprint sensor, fast charging, good speaker.Thank you

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s is a budget segment mid-range phone with all the high end features that distinguishes it from the competition.  It has a crisp Infinity-O AMOLED 6.5 inch display, and a big 6000 mAh battery with reverse charge bundled with a USB Type-C to Type-C cable, a Single Take camera feature with quad-camera and single-LED flash, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner along with the power button on the right (firsts for the Galaxy M series), USB Type-C port, 3.5mm audio jack, Speaker at the bottom, Secondary Microphone at the top, support for Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi ac, and GPS as well as dual 4G and VoLTE, a bundled 25W USB Type-C fast charger in the box (again a first for the Galaxy M series), has a somewhat new design that makes it stand out compared to its siblings in the Galaxy M series that makes Samsung Galaxy M31s look premium with a plastic back glossy finish which Samsung refers to as ‘Glasstic'.  A true value for money and something to keep for years.

Display is Osama s-amoled infinite no comparison with other phones in this range4. Selfi camera is great even you can use it from some distance by just showing your palm towards the camera it captures Selfi so no click needed5.  Quard camera gives a boost with great features like single shot mode for those who are good in clicking pictures and for those who are not good at clicking pictures like me6. I did not find any slowness even when I m playing any games but I am not a hard-core gamer so won't play games like public I am outdoor games lover.Overall a great experience with Samsung M31s. The best part is its a non Chinese product and have better features.

This is how the samsung m31s works for me. Highly disappointed in samsung but highly appreciated the Amazon help mr.

  I posted this review after 2 days usages. Actually, I order this phone for my friend. According to him phone is so smooth and also the screen quality is amazing. Yaahh!!! You cannot get this type of amoled screen from any other brand in this prize segment only samsung providing it!! Both Cameras are very good and screen with infinity-O display looks bigger and brighter!!The battery is massive, the charging time with 25Watt charger (including in box) is around 90-100min but battery back you get with normal social media usages and YouTube usages is around 30-36hrs which is incredible!!Note:- this phone comes with Exynos 9611 octacore professor which is quite disappointing. This processor is 1½ years old. Their is no problem with this processor for normal usages but if you r heavy gamer and want to play PUBG, Asphalt like games in high or Ultra-High graphics then this phone might not for you!!So, at last my recommendation is that , if you r a normal user who not played game alot and only usage is social media and multimedia then must go for this phone!!Bcoz you cannot get this type feature from any other smartphone brand and major highlight is that this phone is made in India and samsung is not a Chinese brand also samsung Knox security is very good!! So must buy!!!But if you're heavy gamer then you can ignore this phone, final decision is yours!!👍

    Best non-chinese phone under 20k range.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This phone is best non Chinese option under 20k with best battery and Camera performance. If I would rate it under 5 here are my ratings following after usage for 10 days.1. Battery performance - 5/5It would last for nearly 1.5-2 days for normal usage. Very well optimised under One UI 2.1, 6000mah2. Camera performance - 4/5Sony IMX 682 sensor in Samsung really does good job but after image processing it stays on the cooler side. Single shot option is good for fancy photography.3. Side fingerprint - 4.5/5Its faster than In display fingerprints of Samsung A series.4. Speaker performance - 4/5Its not stereo speaker but its very loud and good single speaker.6. Processor - 3/5Exynos 9611 is one generation old and its good for normal users but not as good as Snapdragon 720g or 730g for heavy usages and gaming. And Samsung should improve it as soon as possible because its of one generation back and Chinese company provide Snapdragons in this budget range.Samsung should also provide Corning Gorilla glass 5 and + as other Chinese phones comes with.Knox security is here in this phone but not its full version.And major missing is NFC support which Samsung doesn't provide in M series but it should as phones range is 20k which is higher.

  Device is just too good to view content in very aspect. A 6000mah battery haven't impressed a lot becoz of obsessed ONE UI running in the background, but it took me for a walk all over the day. No complaints on ram management and app response times with no lag. Though a glastic back, which can be covered by a premium back case, the screen seems to be flawless and perfect. I had some network issues with the device in my area. Network grasping of the device near villages where we usually feel very low network ranges is very poor. I tested this with my other two mobiles and came to know that data speeds are very low on m31s. But in towns and cities and places near to celltowers the network speeds are amazing.Camera is most attractive featute of the device. Thanks to its fantastic dynamic range.Overall, the device is a perfect all rounder at the price point with many pros and little cons. Not to say perfect, but stands out on its mark.Maynot be a value for money product but you can go for it blindly if you are day to day user.SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.

Both front and back are awesome.4. Awesome design. When u will take it in hand it's feels like premium phones. Back panel is plastic but trust me u will not feel it. It's feels like glass.And that Punch hole is like extra cashew in your milkshake.5. One UI is very smooth and easy to use. Dark mode and always on display are one ofmy favorite feature.6. U can control ur notification panel with ur fingerprint sensor. This is my favorite feature of one UI. It's very helpfull. No device will give u this feature.7. No heating issue.8. Knox security is there.Cons:1. Processor is exynos 9611, but if u r not a gamer, then this phone is best for u in this price range.2. Fingerprint positioning should be in display. It's not justifying with amaloed display.3. No secure folder.Conclusion: If u r not a heavy gamer, then this phone is best for you under 20000.

I've 2 Airtel number and on calling to the number using in samsung galaxy m31s most of the time I've says the number you have dialed is out of network coverage area while on second or third try the call is successfuly connected and again after some time same thing repeating again. On other number using in different device has no issue.Trying to test one or two more days if the issue persist then I'll try to replace it

  While i was searching for a non-chinese phone - Samsung came to my rescue, it was about to release M31s, a replica of M31 - with very few minor enhancements. Was eagerly waiting for it and at last ordered on the launch date.Ordered at midnight!! A class delivery - reached quickly on 10 Aug.The expectation was almost met with the phone - with the satisfaction of not using a Chinese phone.I am not a gamer, so did not notice a drop in performance so far.Display is crystal clear and camera is good. Yet to experience in depth camera features.Finger print scanner is descent enough and face recognition is also good - though disabled it.The battery life is good and stands for 1.5 days with complete basic usage - WA/Mails/Calls.I have to come back after a better usage in a month or two.I agree on the decision to stop earphones, as we have our own desires on the model - but I would recommend Samsung to add a basic silicon back case going forward in the box - so that we can use it from day-1 with ease. This phone was quite slippery, so had to handle with extra caution. I ordered the case, on the same launch day.Overall good, but the price could have been much more competitive - as almost the same price as M31.On a side note - i also saw some bad experience with few Users where the phone did not start-up and went dead in 2 days. I think those are very rare conditions and could happen with any electronic gadgets. Samsung/Amazon should definitely get back to these clients and serve them as quick as possible, to maintain the customer service.

  Samsung M31s - Good camera quality with high-resolution pictures. Perfect battery backup. I use this phone the whole day after a full charge and the phone has a good battery backup. I like the phone and pictures clicked from this phone is far better than the other phone in the same price range. I love the Samsung m31s quality and processor. Almost perfect in the given price range. Value for money.The sound quality is also good in videos, youtube, songs, and also in video recording.

  Its a nice phone. Fantastic  battery life. Camera is of awesome quality. I am charging once in 2 days. I can connect to my Samsung TV with single touch through smart view option... advantage now both belong to Samsung family...Above was the initial review. On 8th/9th day onward, we could see the unclear photos in video call (both IMO and whatsapp). Recently Amazon has changed the return policy to 7 days. Talked to Samsung customer care for many times. They reset camera setting and mobile setting. Still the same issue persists. It seems the phone is not catching the network properly as it took 13 min to download IMO whereas 40 secs for another phone under same wifi. Now I am directed to Samsung service center. Let's see how it goes. I also got similar feedbacks from another 3 buyers.

  It was really disappointing on the day it was delivered,  the phone was not meeting any expectation apart from the wide angle. It was heating and lagging, technician visited who was very unhelpful but gradually the phone behaved better.The phone is no doubt good but I expected the camera better. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the side so it accidentally touches and says multiple attempts but that is not a big deal. The battery is awesome, very long lasting and the super charger charges the phone really quick. The wide angle camera is awesome. The phone has a lotttaaaa space The worst thing in this phone is the macro camera.I purchased the phone on the day it was launched and till now it is working well (bolbona beshi!!!) I'm always a Samsung lover ❤I'm happy with the phone. I'm annoyed, people from Samsung/Amazon keeps on calling me twice a day to write the review so here I am writing to avoid further phone calls 😂

  The product is undoubtedly a market mover I. Its range, keeping in mind the fact that this is a Non-Chinese, trustworthy brand that is made as well as assembled in India. Now talking about the phone, the UI is amazing. Previously, I owned a Samsung J series smartphone and then switching to this is such a lovely experience for me.I have done a full charge test, and believe me the fast charging is an icing on the cake which unexpectedly comes with this handset. My phone took a total, to charge its monster 6000 mAh battery, 107 minutes from 0-100%. The optimisation truly works. The battery backup is good, sound and video qualities are Uber awesome. Camera is well designed. Screen looks premium that you may find in samsung flagship models. All in all, I'll give you a big thumbs up if you have made up your mind to buy this phone.The only problem with me is the processor, it could have been better than this when we are paying more than 20k for this. Never mind, I am more than happy with the chipset and processor because I am not a very heavy user. I hardly play any high-graphic games on this. For me, it works good.If you want a phone that meets all your expectations in a range of 20k, blindly go for this. I have the 8 gb 128 gb variant, and I got a flat discount of INR 1500/- through my HDFC credit card on the prime day sale on 5th of this month. If the offer is still there, go and avail it if you've a HDFC credit card with you.

  Review after 20 days usage:Highlights:1. A WOW display ! - A vivid display with stunning colours and sharpness, which makes an amazing viewing experience. Videos and photos are a pleasure to watch.2. Battery - 6000 mAh monster battery - easily lasts for more than 30 hours with average usage3. Design - A more premium looking smatphone at this price segment4. Camera - 64 MP quad camera surely lives upto its expectations. A plethora of options to exploreWhat could have been better:1. Fingerprint sensor - the side mounted finger print sensor could be annoying at times. Not so fast2. Taking screenshot is not so easy - a simple button in the top navigation panel could have been awesome.The overall performance in my last 20 days of moderate usage has been excellent. The touchscreen works smoothly. So far, I dint encounter hanging while using any of the apps. A very satisfying and pleasant experience so far with the mobile.

  This phone makes me saying this, you can't judge Samsung by just its specs. Using this phone from last 5 days, and believe me, it worth every single penny, I spent, At least for me.Upgraded from OnePlus 3T, and reason behind loving this phone is, it's epic display and buttery one UI. And, this are the only thing I care for, because I am not a gamer, so 9611 is more than required for me. As far as there is no lags in UI, it's fine for me, and there is no lags at all.In hand feel is also good, while holding this no one can agree that it is having 6000mah battery, Thumb up for this. I was able to pull out ~9 hr of screen on time. And speakers are also enough loud and clear.If you are not a HARD-CORE gamer then go for it. (Reason behind highlighting hard-core, many people play 2-3 rounds of pubg and refer themselves hard-core gamer, No you are not. And who plays games like COC, you don't even need to think)Let me tell you again, It's UI and Display is insanely great. After this, I really really think, OnePlus's Oxygen Os is totally over-rated.One more thing, Samsung do not provide case and screen protector out of the box, this is not a big thing, still annoying.

    Buy this only if you want to avoid buying a Chinese brand! No distinctive features.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  First things first, bought a Samsung phone after ages, only to avoid buying a Chinese device. There's no great love for Samsung, considering that over the years many brands have offered better features and service at a better cost than Samsung. Majority of the people who have purchased Samsung this year are only buying to avoid Chinese products.Okay, so bought this phone for my Dad. He was previously using a Realme 2 for 3 years and trust me, the device even now is working like a charm. Just wanted him to have a new phone as a Diwali gift, hence bought the M31s. His usage is primarily Whatsapp, Mails, Browsing, Facebook and some Youtube intermittently.Mentioning a few things I've observed over the past few days:1) The Samsung AMOLED screen is truly a class apart. This is the biggest & only pro.2) Battery life is average; definitely not as claimed by Samsung.3) Even though the RAM is 6 GB, lags are often observed while opening multiple functions. Other devices with these specs deliver a seamless experience.4) 128 GB was a good choice. Anything below that is simply not sufficient these days.5) Samsung does not provide a screen guard or back case with the device; that's just annoying. All other brands include these in the package at this range of 16k-20k.6) Camera is average, but for parents it's not a prerequisite anyway.7) Phone does heat up intermittently; which shouldn't be the case with a device sporting such specs.8) Samsung acts like a cheap Chinese brand by constantly trying to push sponsored content and apps in your face. Especially during the setup, be careful what you're ticking, otherwise your phone will be loaded with garbage.9) Samsung UI is not the best in the market. Could be more seamless.10) Sound is fairly loud and can be counted as an advantage.11) No option of setting local ringtones for select contacts. (This was a great disappointment for my Dad!)12) The SIM/Memory Card tray is designed in the most third-rate way.13) Phone weight is an issue. There are many alternatives in this price range which feel lighter in your hand.14) The fingerprint reader is placed in the WORST manner. For parents, this is sure to be a major obstacle. It should have just been in the usual back area.15) The power key feels a bit unsure, sort of wobbly when you touch it.All-in-all, you're only left with Samsung to choose if you're sure of not opting for a Chinese brand. Ideally, the M31s should be priced in the 15k range.

  After 1month of use, the phone is a total monster. The smoothness is good. Battery life excellent. It gives me a back up for 3 days. Charging has improved with the 25W Super Fast Charger. Display is awesome. The punch hole camera looks cool. The rear camera set up is good. There are a lot of camera modes, but 64MP camera isn't good enough. The zooming quality is not that good, especially when it's 10x. But still the AR zone, hyperlapse, super slow motion, makes it perfect. The quality of night mode is unbelievable, even your eyes won't see that much of light in night. The gaming performance is excellent. The back looks stunning with the Mirage Blue variant.Overall the phone is a real beast.Best phone I've ever experienced.

Rival phones from the likes of Xiaomi, POCO and Realme use Snapdragon 720G / 730G or MediaTek G90T chipsets, which are more performance-oriented. If benchmarks are looked at, the M31s’ scores do fall behind.

    Samsung Galaxy M31s disappointed with 2 problems
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Samsung Galaxy M31s, I ordered this phone in Amazon's first sale on 7th August. And this phone was delivered to me on the 13th of August.  So I am reviewing this phone today on September 9, after using it for 27 days.Design : This phone is very good in terms of look and design.Display : The screen is very good, no problem watching videos and browsing the internet.Camera: The camera of this phone is also very good. Captures high resolution in 64 megapixel.Front Camera: The front camera does not take clear pictures, it makes it slightly fed up.Touch Response : Touch response is also very good, no problem. No lag problems were seen yet.RAM Management : RAM remains in memory for a long time. RAM management is very well optimized.Sound : Speaker volume is very loud but not like stereo speaker.Internet Speed : Any website opens in seconds. Internet speed is also great.Battery : I noticed a battery drain issue in this phone. I don't know if the other user's phone has a battery problem or not, but the automatic battery in my phone keeps getting low. And while using the phone, 1% of the battery runs out in 3-5 minutes. Sometimes 7 to 9% of the battery in the phone ends up on its own in a few hours. It seems that a 6000 mAh battery is equivalent to 4000 mAh.Heating : This phone also has a heating issue, sometimes when charging the phone, the temperature reaches 48 degrees and 42 to 43 degrees in normal use. And in WhatsApp calling, the phone gets very hot and the call is cut automatically.PROS :Good Camera QualityBetter PerformanceFast ChargingAwesome Display QualityCons :Battery Drain issueHeating issueI hope Samsung resolves these issues in the next update.

Fingerprint also in different position gives new experience. Samsung always gives first preference to security, In M31s security is also best.

  Pros:+ The display is the standout feature here, just brilliant.+ Battery life is very good & fulfills its promise, lasting more than a day & a half.+ Nice sound too from a single speaker, it can get rather loud.Middling/undecided:= Camera seems good enough but I haven't tested it much beyond some nice indoor selfies in artificial light.= Responsive enough for daily use by a senior person, not intending to use this for heavy gaming at all.= The 128GB storage & Dedicated SD card support is good enough at the Rs.19.5k price range (as of September 2020) & should keep things comfortable without needing to continuously make space available for the long run.Cons:- Samsung's software, had to tinker around & change or remove some apps like Phone to Google defaults because the alternatives weren't as customizable or familiar. Tries to install a lot of bloat during setup. If you like Samsung's ecosystem features then this shouldn't stop you.- The fingerprint sensor isn't as sharp as it could have been & is hit & miss. Being on the edge gives it a learning curve as your finger needs to be positioned correctly to cover the sensor.

   Hi,This Samsung M31s is a good phone.. Now its more than a month I am using this phone so I can give genuine ewviews on it.I am using it without any screen protection... Still not a single scratch on my screen.. Voice quality and sound is perfect.. Screen brightness is also good.. U can see the pics I have uploaded here for camera quality, I am satisfied with it.. I charge my phone ones in 2 days.. I face only one issue, if u put ur screen off while ur any app is open, the same page will stick onscreen... Means when u again put on ur screen u will find the same app page sticked.. U will have to close ur app and again start to work on it.. Initially I had faced some Internet connectivity issues in both WiFi and mobile data but that was very well solved by Samsung technision through an online service via Samsung tuitor app I.e. Preintalled in the phone. This app is very much useful.. One can have resolution of any problem sitting at home.. U can chat or even talk to Samsung technicians with no additional cost..I have purchased a Samsung phone after many years of using mi phones... Believe me mi is not bad atall but Samsung is better...

So I request samsung to please take a look on this because it is would be a better for Samsung brand to make a better profit and sales.

  I gave ip one plus to buy this. I am totally satisfied on the performance. I have used apple phone  too but thus one is the best. 8 GB Ram makes its performance superfast in the digital highway. And with clear photographs and videos, I am not disappointed. Excellent camera for selphies, too. Battery life is great as i recharge only once despite a heavy rush of Company emails  global teleconferences and other stuff. Fingerprint reader is better than the best.

  The overall product is good but the camera is pathetic. Being the 64 MP it has very poor image resolution. The picture quality gets deteriorated on just zooming it. The front camera being 32 MP is giving by default 5 MP image and with two person in it gives 8 MP, but has the same image deterioration on zooming it. What is purpose being 32 MP on when your getting 5 & 8 MP picture.  The Samsung needs to seriously look on such issue of camera image quality. As they push this model based on the 64 MP sony camera with better resolution which was lacking immensely. Even the Amazon technician did not resolved the issue and has to finally return the product.

    3 BEST's - Build Quality, Camera, Sound Quality
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.

  Over all this phone is amazing basically my brother bought this for him but i exchanged it with his old samsung note 8...and i instantly became a huge fan of it...Good things about the phone is you cannot empty the battery even after long hours of gaming(PUBG*before ban*, COD, Modern warfare.etc.) also the finger print reader is way too snappy. I'm a bit of a techie guy and choose phones after reading lot of reviews. This phone is worth all the money you've spent. Plus it looks cool, back cover is necessary its delicate backa nd camera bump. Rest phone is perfect and camera is quite good at this price with some major feature and some useless feature which i dont use at all.I recommend this phone for daily as well as gaming purpose, it serves you well with more then 6 hrs battery remaining once you decide to go sleep after a day usage. Thats crazy.

  Impressive camera setup. Have attached samples of 123° ultrawide, macro, food photo & 64 mp along with the pics of the phone front and rear. The battery life is astonishing.. I cud get almost 3 days juice out of a single charge.. I am not an extensive user and I use Bluetooth for my calls. The display is just fab and the UI is ultra smooth unlike the BADA which used to be on older phones. This is the best phone one can pick in the price segment.

  I am using the Samsung M31s phone which was purchased on Sep 3rd,2020. I started having troubles with using the apps in my phone within 1 month of purchase. If my phone goes to the sleep mode automatically while using an app,after I unlock my phone I need to exit the app and reopen it if I need to use it again,otherwise the app gets stuck. I had given my phone for service, to solve this problem, but it still persists.

  Never go with the brand name Samsung. It justs takes advantage of Boycott Chinese products campaign.I have been using Redmi close to 4 yrs before buying this phone. Let me tell you the most irritating defects of this mobile.1. If you open any application and the phone locks after the timeout, when you unlock, the application which was opened is freezed. You need to tab to other application or click Back button twice. Which means you were watching a video and  you lock the phone in between for some work to continue when you are back. Once you are back, the screen is freezed and you need to go back twice, u might miss that video again.This is not only with my mobile, i checked in the forum and found many has this issue. Not coz of many applications or storage problem.2. No simple way to take a screenshot. You need a tool extra for it. The default swipe will work once in 10-15 times.I repent buying this mobile, i would have opted Redmi instead...

  I have my little story about M31S & Amazon to share! I bought M31S in August 2020 then after 9 days I had to replace it coz it suddenly stopped charging!  I got the replacement from amazon. From the date I received after 14 days same issue again. Not getting charged! Phone was able to charge with other charger and the charger was able to charge other phone. After getting same defect again I asked amazon to either give me replacement or take this product back! I talked with almost 4 Customer Executive including Senior one and even sent them e-mails! They were literally slamming back to back same statement ""its out of return period and we can't take it back. That's our Policy"" . So they asked me to bring ""Service Denial Letter"" from Samsung Service Center and after that they will initiate my request. When I reached out to service center they said that they don't provide such kind of letter. Once the phone reach to their service center they just repair it anyhow. Samsung also have other policy which is literally of no use if you are purchasing online that If I would have come between first 14 days after purchase then they would have gave me replacement. I mean WTF! !So technically 14 days will start from the date of ORDER PLACED so, its of no use! Then I just gave it for repairing. I had no choice. I was lost. I invested 19500 rupee to get a defective product! Its not a small amount! I was literally getting killed by stress! It was my second time having similar experience and yet they were not helping me. Last time it was with ZUK Z2 plus. It literally had manufacturing defect of ghost touch. Ghost touch is while charging you get multiple touch response for one single touch. I mean seriously put bots instead of humans for Customer support. In the end both are doing same work! HARASSING AND BULLYING!!

  Must Buy in the mid range . Best Display , Best Camera , Smooth Performance.1. PERFORMANCEThe performance of this phone is perfect. BUT NOT FOR HEAVY GAMERS . Normally 1-2 hours of PUBG is OK but not for several hours. Its processor is bit Older but its optimization is so much good . You will not face any single issue regarding its performance.Fingerprint Sensor is working smoothly. But face unlocking takes few seconds as i think it is for security purpose only. You can change the face recognition settings to fast mode.2. CAMERAIts Camera is the main highlight in this phone.it shots pretty impressive pictures . If you are selfie lover then GO for it. It wont disappoint you. In low light also it takes quite good pictures.3.BATTERYUhh!! It has a huge monster battery of 6000mAh. You can understand the backup of this phone. I cant say anything about its battery. Don't bother about its battery backup.4.DISPLAYThe samsung AMOLED displays are in TOP in the market. Awesome display I can say...........................................................................................................................................................................................And Yeah Samsung gives variety of features in this phone. You will find interesting about it.Till now i haven't got any issue regarding this phone.NOTE  :  NOT FOR HEAVY GAMING.Overall a Best Phone .I hope this finds you HelpfulThank You..

  I mostly like the camera which has a lot of great features, the main part is the awesome battery lasts up to 12 hours of continuous usage of apps and games. Usually, I start using my phone morning 7 and it lasts till evening 7 and the 25 W superfast charger charges my phone within 1hr 40min, and it uses Exynos 9 octa 9611 it uses a 10 nm semiconductor which is a little bit old processor even it is old it performs great because it has multiple core support(4x2.39Hz with 9 octa-core) and Mali G72 mp3 GPU so in gaming pubg mobile can be played in HD High without lag and it gives seamless multitasking you can switch between games and other apps easily with a single Slide Navigation bar gestures). I have not used mobiles with Samsung's Exynos processor, I just brought this as a try but this amazed me. The fingerprint scanner and face unlock is very fast and the display is great, it comes with an infinite-o-super Amoled display and I can watch my favorite series and movies on Netflix and Prime video in 1080p and I can experience the Dolby atmos in wired and Bluetooth headphones or earphones The gradient color and design is elegant I love it so I've brought a transparent case and it is also secured by Knox you can see in settings and also when the phone gets booted up. I heard that this was the competition for one plus Nord, by my experience, it does with the camera and battery and other things are the same. This is the best phone at this budget.

  It's been around a week since am using this phone. Overall pretty good phone. Since am a normal user I don't actually needed high performance like for gamers. For normal use this is good.What I have liked about phone is the design and color of it. Felt little heavy to hold, but it's ok since they are giving 6000 mah battery. So it's acceptable.One thing I felt disliked is the fingerprint. Which they have given under volume buttons. Most of us use mobile covers so it will be uncomfortable to use fingerprints.Battery life is good. For normal use it comes for 2days if u charge it full.Camera is pretty good. And display is nice.You can go for it under budget 20k smartphone. And ofcourse for samsung brand

  It's a review after two weeks of usage. Battery life is damn good. Even after my hectic day when my old phone needed a charge this shows 50% remaining. Camera is super awesome. 64 MP  camera is true to its name. Single mode is another feather in the cap. The display is awesome and can be read in bright daylight with auto adjustable brightness. It has Knox security and samsung Max which is a VPN to protect your phone from hackers and anything wrong through the internet. The phone is zippy fast. The front camera is also capable of 4k recording . The side key touch is a bit nagging thing though because the way I hold it. The notification alsways comes up as with the slide on the lock button the notification panel opens up. Ignoring this minor glitch the phone is highly recommended for the price range it is available at and biggest of all is it is MADE IN INDIA.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  At the beginning i felt the battery is weak which was getting emptied at the soonest time. Later i found the inner settings of the mobile and it is running good and for me 100% charge is getting consumed for around 25-30 hours. Camera quality is really awesome and have wonderful clarity with high pixels for both rear and selfie cameras. In-built features also good when compared to other similar ranged smartphones. As per my experience and requirement, 6 GB is more than enough. So suggest to purchase 6GB rather than investing extra 2k just for 2GB more. The main reason for me to buy this is not manufactured in China and i was supposed to change the bloody China phone Redmi. But the only fault i found is network issues. Even after checked with service center guys, i am getting network issues. Even though there will be 75% coverage of network, internet doesnt work properly. Checked area network capacity tbru telecom company and it was good.Please dont buy this phone if you are using Jio sim. Even with 70-80% network coverage, even 2g network of jio will not work. I am really disappointed with this. Even after complained in Samsung service center, there is no use.Overall this phone is worthy for the 20k compared to other brands for the price. You can purchase this confidentally if you are looking for a good smartphone with best camera and battery smartphone in 20-22 k.

  The video stability needs a lot of improvement l, in this price segment these things should be more refined. Also, photos in low inditect sun light or artificial lights needs improvement  as it has noise in the images. I think this is just a image processing thing which can be imlroved with the updates. Else  I simply love ghe phone. Being  a Samsung  member for the past 10 years its been a nice experience.

  Using for 3 months now. Keeping everything short:-Performance: it's a smooth experience! Though I don't play games.Camera: I am in love with it.Though,The macro camera is of no use.The single take feature is of no use for meBut the HDR and AI are well optimised in this device.Vid quality is decent.Has electronic image stabilization.Display: I would have given 10 stars out of 5 if it was possible. Brilliant display with great quality! Even in direct sunlight.Supports always on display.The hole punch is quite small. And after few days it's nearly unnoticeable.Battery: if you are buying it because of 6000 mah battery, you might not be pleased.I am just getting a day out of it!Charging: just after 3 months it's taking 2.5 hrs (approx) to charge fully.I am disappointed with the charger.22 W charger is just a mental peace thing!Design: looks beautiful in hand. But a fingerprint magnet. And please use case. My one got a scratch from my finger ring.Touch screen: works even with wet fingers.Fingerprint: wet hands will not work.Even with light sweat, the fingerprint stops working.UI: I felt the UI is lot better than redmi and realmi.Add free and smooth experience.Special: it has a grip sensor which detects how you are holding the phone and adjusts it's antennas according to get the best signal.If you have this device you can check your grip sensor.Dial *#0*# and then select grip sensor.It's amazing!Conclusion:If you want brilliant camera and the best display in this price range, go for it.You will love it.But if you just want battery, I will suggest not to go with this device.

    Best M-series phone from Samsung to date.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Samsung has released M31s with updated design. Here are the pros and cons after a week of using the phone.Pro:1) The display is best in class and comparable to premium smartphones. If you use the phone in dark mode, you will love the deep black and vivid colours. It's definitely a treat to the eyes. I personally prefer AMOLEDs to high refresh LCDs. Hence Samsung has done a wonderful job here.2) The fingerprint reader is mounted on to power button. Its reachable to the thumb and extremely fast. The buttons are tactile and provide good feedback.3) I get close to two days of battery life with regular use. My usages include social media, YouTube and calls. I use two SIMs with internet always active. Even with continuous usage, it will last more than 9 hours.4) Camera quality is good during day light. Both from Regular and Ultra wide angle camera. During night, the regular camera did decent job. Photos are attached for the same. The selfie is awesome in this phone.5) I was sceptical about the performance considering the processor. But I couldn't find any lag or heating in my day to day use. I am not an avid gamer, hence I can't vouch for this processor to gamers.6) The weight distribution has been good and you won't find the phone to be bulky. It's usable by one hand too.7) Single take, reverse charging, fast charging, triple slot are all the extra features which makes the phone good.Con:The price. Even though I have no complaints about the processor for my day to day use, as they have increased the price of the phone by around 2.5k in comparison to M31 they could have gone for a more powerful processor.Conclusion:If you are a casual user who wants phone for media consumption (Good display+Battery) and don't mind the 19.5k price, you can wholeheartedly go for this. You won't regret.

  Well, I am not much of big user of phones for Games / Photos.I basically wanted to avoid Chinese phone (for reasons best known to all) and actually my earlier phone display got damaged during lockdown time (due to sanitizing).This phone as such when used for last one week, I was initially concerned on battery life as per few of earlier reviews. but to my surprise it give me proper timeline of 2 days with almost 10-12 hrs of mobile hotspot usage for my office work & calls (both audio & video). It still has some 10% battery left after almost 40 hrs of last charging. Also as mentioned it gets almost charged within 2 hrs.Rest honestly have not much tried taking any of monster shots / camera usage hence wont able to comment on that. But yes rest all usage was nice upto expectations. Finger sensor had been really good with my first thumb sensor but other hand finger sensor is not working that properly, may be i will activate it again.Yes, some of samsung pre-installed apps is bit of headache to get rid off it not used.One more thing, if as everyone says yes bit disappointed as there has been no backcover given.Samsung how much it would have taken to give one proper backcover and one earphones too. (is that too much to ask for - no earphones !! really surprised )Finally, yes it's slightly overpriced.. anything around 18K would have been better but 22k is bit 4k on higher side (would not have still not been minding it if proper backcover and earphones if had been given).Overall for me it's a good phone as for now.... hope to review further after an month usage.

For best performance, switch to a static wallpaper and Remove the unnecessary apps that can be removed and disable the rest.

  See.. I'm being a tech enthusiast, writing this review!!! I've used this phone for almost 2 weeks!! See first of all I'll tell u that if u r a gamer don't prefer this phone..if u are a normal user u can choose it!!I'm being a student I faced no problems or any bugs using this phone!! The One UI which is the latest one is very user friendly and gives u a Very premium experience while using this phone..See, in a phone the hardware is important but the software should be optimised too otherwise there's no use of being a high level hardware..see it's battery is the best.. display is very amazing..6.5"" sAmoled display is a decent size but it's colors and saturation is very Greattttt guys!! Trust me, if u want a non Chinese phone under 20k it's the best thing u can get for a normal user like me!! I use the phone from 9am to 11pm continuosly nearly I keep my phone for 2 or 3hrs aside,It gives me a full day battery experience..I charge 1time in morning bas! So battery is the best!! Thumb's up 👍🏻 Now coming to camera it comes with sony imx 682 sensor which clicks very accurate photos in day and night too!! See for this price the night shots are also good not that bad!! If u will use night mode for low light shots it can click the best...but if there's very less light then better use flash😉 So conclusion is u can buy this phone and it justifies it's price so u can go for it!!🤟🏻

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 managed to make a good impact in the budget segment thanks to its crisp AMOLED display and a big battery, which helped distinguish it from the competition. Samsung has now launched its successor, called the Galaxy M31s. The new Galaxy M31s sports an Infinity-O display and the Single Take camera feature, both firsts for the Galaxy M series. Starting at Rs. 19,499, do these new features justify the higher price? I review the Galaxy M31s to find out.spent the last five days with the Galaxy M31s, and here is my take on the phone.Samsung Galaxy M31s specifications: 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display| Samsung Exynos 9611|6GB RAM/8GB RAM, 128GB storage, microSD support included|6000mAh battery, 25W fast charging support|32MP front camera, 64MP main camera+12MP ultra wide camera+5MP depth camera+5MP macro camera||Android 10, OneUIThe Galaxy M31s reminds me of the Galaxy A51 in terms of design language. The front of the phone has an edge-to-edge 6.5-inch AMOLED display and a small hole for the front-facing camera. Flip the phone, and you will notice the rectangular camera bump on the top left – the setup is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, a speaker and a headphone jack.I buyed for youtube channel review but it's a average good performance  experience give to me

  First usage reviews....Awesome power packed phone.Pros1. The usp of the phone is the finger print reader. Perhaps, I say it is more convenient and faster then face unlock.2. The display is excellent. You really enjoy watching videos on it.3. Battery backup is good and fast charge is brilliant.4. The OS works smoothly.Cons1. Weighs a little more.2. Samsung has given a mono speaker, which I think at this price is not fair. Stereo speakers were expected.Detailed review will be posted after few days of usage.

  Excellent and undoubtedly ""Number One"" Non-Chinese brand phone in the market under 20K.I have upgraded from A6+ to M31s. I am extremely happy. Screen resolution, Superfast Baterry charging, Excellent camera.Fastest service by Amazon. I received the phone in less than 14 hrs after ordering on amazon.Used Great Indian Festival sale with HDFC discount and Exchange.Its C type charging cable is different compare to the other c type of cables due to its reverse charging feature. it has C type connector at both ends compare to one side c connector and another side USB type.No complaint.Thank you Samsung and Amazon.

  Superb mobile by Samsung......Best display,camera,battery in a midrange budget.We can go for it with eyes closed.Best UI, Good processor for its budget,25w fast charging,smart switch,6000mah battery.But the worst delivery package ever.The package was not rolled by a thick sheet or by thermocoal sheet etc....Just covered with a very normal low quality courier cover without any outer package.I had ordered different products around some 25 times in Amazon till now...This time was my highest budget and the package was the cheapest and worst among all....Had little touch issue in the beginning but everything seems fine as of now.They provide big and neatly covered package for some 500rs grocery items but giving this much cheap package for 19k mobile coming from 1200kms is really disappointing.... please keep extra concern on this Amazon....

  Battery drainage issue is there in ideal condition in 1 hour battery drainage is about 5 to 6%. Processor is not heating but lags most of the time .This was the first and last time I brought samsung device. I brought only because of non-chinese device and I believe that they fooled Indian so good. Go for Nokia or any other brand non-chinese  device but believe me. Don't waste money in this crisis time. The internet speed is really slow as it does not support 4g+ it only support 4g volte which is also minus point. All in all totally unsatisfied with the device . Those who brought the phone please complaint to Samsung customer service to enable 4g+ volte as device support but in M series phone they have locked it . It can be enabled by ota update .

  First of all great battery life. I have been using the phone for 8 days now and I need to charge it once in 36 hours only inspite of heavy usage, it takes about  100 minutes for a full change. The camera as expected is really good,  this photo was taken from a moving vehicle at almost  50kmph . The touch is butter smooth and one hand operation is a breeze . The finger print sensor works really  well and the display and colors are wonderful. Specs are best in class .All in all a great phone and i fully recommended it.

  Posting reveiw after 1.5 month of usage.Pros :Good camera features.Cons: Started facing hanging issues and slowness in phone. Face unlock feature is not very effective. Whenever the phone is unlocked it hangs and any application opened already hangs the screen. Thiw needs forced closure of application and reopen,  which means to loose the data on the applications you had worked on.

  Hey Guys, I Bought this phone in Amazon's Prime day sale. It was delivered within 3 days. Appreciating Amazon's Delivery Service.If you want to see the full Unboxing of this Phone, then you may visit our YouTube -> @shuttertechlearningSo here are my pros and cons for the phone:PROS:-> 6000mAh battery is mind blowing, it is giving a battery backup of average 2 days on normal use> Amoled screen is mind blowing, with a on-screen front camera> It is thin and light weight, looks similar like Samsung Note 10> Side Power button with in-built fingerprint sensor is too fastCONS:-> Although not a major cons but camera lacks in low light macro photography.> Back gradient looks awesome but you need to take a good care of it. As it gets easily scratches.Thank You !Stay Home-Stay Safe

Frequently internet get disconnect and even the network go blank and I missed lot of calls.3. Even the same problem with Bluetooth connectivity.4. Camera 64 mp is just doesn't give any crisper photo when go on detail.Im writting this review after using this phone for a month.I really got disappointed.

    Awesome Camera & Superb Battery - Overall Value for Money
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Let's start with pros:Battery - My battery runs for around 48 hours with normal call flow & messages/ WhatsApp, around 1 hour of gaming, 1 hour of Amazon Prime, etc.Camera - Camera output is awesome. Single take feature is superb. It shares 1 best shot, 1 small video, 1 super fast video and 1 reverse video. Front camera is equally good.RAM & ROM - I'm using 8GB & 128GB phone & its performance is up to mark.Sound - Sound is not very extra ordinary for music lovers but when you use speaker for normal calls - it works fine. This phone also has FM radio which most of the companies are not offering now a days.The best feature is placement of finger print sensor. It's at the side of handset - right under the volume control. The placement of this sensor make its use quite handy.Let's go for cons:The only con I could find out is non-availability of a good back/ flip cover. In my view Samsung should start manufacturing the cover along with the handset and bundle it with handset for ease of it's customers.

  It's been a month now, so far no glitch or problem in the phone except the one i.e. Wi-fii stability. It logs out of the wifii connection frequently like atleast once in an hour and needs to sign in again and again and still couldn't sign in immediately, takes time.Really hope Samsung will fix it with some software upgrade.Now about the highlights of the mobile phone:1. Finger print reader- Fab2. Battery- Excellent, I charge it once in a day, if you are a moderate user, battery would last atleast a day and a half. Thumbs up to battery too.3. Camera: Fabulous camera. No complaints.4. Display screen: The best among all the mobiles in this range.5. Touch: Very smooth and precise.6. Bluetooth connectivity: GoodMost important- Not Made in ChinaOverall loving the phone. 4 stars, 1 star down for Wi-fii stability. Please Samsung send some update on that.

  The phone is dead in the first day itself. I wonder is there any quality control in the Samsung. The phone display stopped working, and sometimes flickering a lot with green, orange lines. The phone even rings and I could be able hear the message tones as well, but screen is dead - not able to even backup anything. Worst Quality. Didn't expected this from Samsung.The phone also comes with lot of bloatware softwares, these get install automatically at the time of setup. Even if we try to skip and cancel - it is not allowing us to do so. Why should we have to live with all unwanted apps.Seems like a marketing fraud - over rated and created hype. Worst build quality.Now I am waiting for the refund.

  I have been using the Samsung M31s for a week now. The phone is worth the money you pay. The display is phenomenal. Storage and RAM is good. Camera is decent. Only thing that you will not like is processor if you play games. Or else you will really love this phone. Its not too heavy east yo hold even with case. Battery will last around 1.5 days. This phone can be used as a powerbank also. Speaker sound quality is decent. Fingerprint reader is fast and placed well (Atleast for me).When I unboxed the phone I found that the travel adapter had big scratches and looked like used one. And the Type C cable also had a slight damage. Apart from that Phone was well packed.

  I m not that satisfied with camera quality as much I was expecting looking at the description of the product. Especially for night mode. Battery life is also running like 4500-5000mh battery. Well there is no lag or performance issues I have noticed so far. I was expecting more features in camera to get better quality image as compared to redmi phones. If you are looking for Samsung or okay to compromise bit with camera quality then go for it. In the end, camera is not too bad, only it is not up to expectations of the advertisement.

  Overall phone is good.Pros: New features and gestures added to the phone are very good.Cons:1. The processor could have been better.2. The main rear camera is a little disappointing. I tried comparing camera with old mi A3 and OnePlus 5t, I get superior photo quality in these 2 older phones and even in old mi A3 budget smartphone. The photos in Samsung m31s captured by rear camera are more whitish and not clear and detailed.Maybe Samsung could fix these camera problems with a new software update. But below 20k mid-range smartphones, the expectations are higher than budget smartphones. And these problems should overcome.

At home I have PC , TV etc that i use for gaming or watching movies.. I use mobile for its main purpose only, so I am not disappointed but price is little bit higher. And same old design. Poor samsung cant make better looking mobiles. Always they make cheap plastic body. And then claminng 64 mp camera, 6 gb ram and bla bla. For taking pictures i use my nikon camera. . I just want phone simple good looking and only for normal use. They cant make 2 stereo loud speaker phone? Then cant make its look better? But they r focused on 256mp camera. And 10 cameras on 1 phone. Jokers :))

  Battery life and fast charging is excellent. Phone runs upto 2 days with single charge for me  with an average screen time of 6 hrs per day with sync, gps and mobile data turned on.  Camera is also good (especially the features like pro,  slow motion and time laps ). but sometimes I felt camera application is slow. Phone is good enough for daily usage when battery is less. I'm using more than 55 applications other than the preinstalled applications haven't noticed any difficulties in multi tasking. I have played PUBG too, but it was not that great experience because of heating issue after continuous usage.The side mount fingerprint scanner is a excellent feature especially easy when using bigger phones. But sometimes its tricky especially when ur hand is slightly wet or something as compared to the back mount ones.Camera, battery life and infinity o sAMOLED display are the features I love in this phone

  I bought samsung M31s for my wife..used for two weeks. C is using mobile for story reading and ludo king only. Earlier c used Redmi note 7 pro.1. Camera: 64MP camera is not like 64MP. It's Sony camera. But redmi note 7 pro camera is better. Front camera is good. Then video quality is good.2. Battery: 6000mah!  It's doubt.. it sucks charge very fast. Within 24 hours more than 90% charge is dried. Charging time also around 2 hours it takes. Redmi note 7 pro is better than this.3. Connectivity: it is very poor. While sending text through what's app, After 30 second only it sends text. C s using Jio sim. No signal issues also. Downloading also very slow. ( I am using moto G5 s plus, it performs better than M31s. I am also using Jio sim.)4. Performance: There is lag in performance of mobile.. it's being very slow. It uses extra storage of 6 GB RAM. Already installed apps occupies 2.5 GB. If we install other app means it occupies 4GB out of 6GB.Redmi note 7 pro performed well than this.5. Display : Very good display. No cons about display.. it has good display..6. Finger print: side finger print option is good.  But it is used only for display on, it does not switch of the display. If we put flip cover, we couldn't register thumb impression on finger print scanner.

  The phone is really good. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its fair share of issues. The major issue i face is with the software. Rest everything works fine. Samsung keeps releasing new bugs in each of their updates. Major software issued I faced are unstable network, app freeze and  data speed issues. Sometimes even if I'm sitting right next to the wifi it shows 1 bar less. And the speed drops considerably. Speed tests indicate really fast speeds but while using the apps it doesn't work at an efficient speed. Especially apps such as YouTube,  whatsapp etc. This im guessing is a software issue. The app freeze is also a software issue.

  Too much of shutter lag in camera. Few lags seen in few application as well. All other things are great. At this price point a good device. They could have given a more Snapdragon chipset.Update: While playing audio with Android auto there is audio drop(kind of skip). Not sure is this is problem with Android auto or phone Bluetooth while playing music. Was using apple before and music was smooth.

  M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed performance"". Used Samsung, Micromax, vivo phones. But the Camera I have never seen this depth, clarity and saturated color photos in any product so far. SPEAKER has a bass touch in it equaling a Stereo speaker. Its Knox protected mobile. Built quality is super premium. Mirage Blue is defines a Class Flagship premium look. Thanks for the rapid Delivery and Amazon packing was secure. A well justified price for the M31s. So what are you waiting for, order it & u will love M31s liquid LPDDR4x RAM speed & a massive 6000mAh with a INTELLI CAMERA, Samsung has really improved the camera segment in M31s.

  Best budget phone.1. Exynos haters, try to keep your data safe with SD processors. Also big brands like Samsung work on optimization which chinese brands can never. So performance is smooth.2. Pubg hangs after 2 hours even in 855 plus phones so really not worth spending more or relying on chinese brands(who start to decline after 1 year.)3. Camera, display, battery, connectivity, Knox security can't get better in this budget.I personally don't care about Samsung pay or else I would have gone for A51.

  One of the best mobile for non hardcore gamers. Battery is really monstrous, as you can see in the graph even after 7 hrs 23 min screen on time, battery used is about 60%.Camera is simply awesome, it makes you feel like a pro photographer. Charging takes slightly less than 2 hrs.Its bit bulky if you compare with samsung A series, but dont worry it wont pain your hand while watching whole mirzapur series in one night. Screen is super awesome, you would love watching HD content over it. And gone are the days when samsung used to lag. Even after 2.5 months its working fluid.Its processor is capable enough to sail you through all the apps (I dont have any idea about gaming apps) without any lag.One of the best thing I like about samsung is its user interface which takes care of all your small small needs, and you wont miss any feature. Go ahead, buy a monster.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  NOT A TECHNICAL BUT AN HONEST USER EXPERIENCE AS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BOW ITS LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE, BEST PERFORMANCE & VIVID CAMERA QUALITY RESULTSBATTERY LIFE:The previous generation samsung phone had only 1 problem i.e., of battery. This has now completely resolved. I use my personal phone same as I use my laptop. Every transaction, business work, personal stuffs name it. Still, due to heavy usage of phone, battery lasted for as much as 48 hours!!!! Can't get any better deal than this at this price.CAMERA:With a quad camera setup of 64 MP, you can snap some of the great memories with your phone. I am more into scanning the documents from a phone than taking snaps of nature and this phone has not discouraged me any way.PROCESSOR:Heavy usage of phone has not discouraged me either in processor. I am not a techno savvy guy still I can write that this phone has got nuts in performing multi-tasking.BUILD QUALITY:Corning gorilla glass and sturdy body frame of phone has not upset me either. Yes phone was drop by me mistakenly on day 1 still no crack or break.What else do you need in a 20-22k price range? Samsung Galaxy M31s is a complete all in one package!!!

  It's been more than 1 week am using it and here is my review on it.Pros1) Great battery backup2) Great Camera, no complaints ( I previously had 2 Xiaomi phones and now I prefer Samsung)3) Dolby sound, very happy with the quality, if you have good headphones you will be happy too.4) Smoot experience, no lag noticed ( before buying this, I have seen reviews on youtube and google and many people were complaining about the processor used in this handset, saying, ""this one is a bit old"" as per them, but honestly, I do not feel any lag or any kind of issue with the processing power, I have not played or tried any games on it and I did not purchase this for games, this phone for me is more for privacy thing as am using bank apps and I do not trust the previous brand for personal or sensitive data.5) I liked the UI and Desktop Hub app in the galaxy store is also available for it, which I will try later.Rest of the good things given in the product descriptionConsFor me, none as this solves my purpose and rear glossy fingerprint magnet does not bother me as I use a protective caseConclusion:-Go for it if you want a handset from a reliable brand.

  Here's my impressions after using this phone for a whileThe setup process: Pretty fast, all it took was for me to login to my accounts and it started restoring from the backupCamera: As I upgraded to this from an Asus ZenFone max M1 the camera is a huge improvement as it doesn't soften the details on the subject and keeps things sharp and realistic especially in selfies!Battery: a chonky 6k mAh battery with 25W fast charging, lasts me 2 days easily with my usage level, charges up in a bit over an hour I thinkDisplay: SAMOLED with the rich blacks and sharp contrast, stick it on dark mode and it basically cruises with very little battery consumptionPorts: Headphone jack is present huzzah! I use it for my zoom classes, sounds just fineProcessor and RAM: Exynos variant but I had no issues in my use whilst multitasking or loading many apps, RAM is plentiful 6GBStorage: a sizeable 128GB and there's always Google photos to backup your clicksSpeaker: mono setup, gets reasonably loud, as long as you don't cover it, it should be fineFingerprint: Fast and accurate, I have no trouble with it whatsoeverAll in all, same form factor as my previous phone, bigger better display, better battery, long support run hopefully, a good purchase for remarkable specs in this price range

  Don't expect much out of this phone. It's an average phone. It's having hanging issue from the second week onwards. I didn't installed any game. Fingerprint reader is slow. Camera is good on the day light shots. But on low light, you can find lot of digital noise in the photos. Battery life is decent. But charging takes more than 2.5 hours (from 0 to 100%). But in description it is mentioned that it'll take 90 mins to reach 100%. WhatsApp sticker installed can't be used/available in the dual WhatsApp app. On this price range, it doesn't fullfill my expectations.

  I wanted to get a new phone for less than Rs 20k. My criteria: good camera, decent battery and not one of the overtly Chinese brands like Mi, Xiaomi, Poco etc. I'd been researching my options for a couple of months and I always ended up at the Samsung store. I was first thinking of the A series phones but then the M31s was launched and it ticked all of my boxes. This phone is a bit of a bday present to myself and I'm quite happy with it. The battery lasts a fair while, the display looks great and I haven't even been able to explore the camera's full capability (lockdown restrictions on going out). If you have similar requirements, this phone is easy to recommend and I'm happy to join the Samsung family.

  if you are looking for a Smartphone in a medium price range. Then this is the best deal. Samsung has created a very beautiful phone. It's got everything. Got my phone on Saturday, since then I just can't stop using it.It's camera is very clear and takes sharp pictures. Now me being a person who loves taking pictures,I enjoyed capturing beautiful mesmerizing shots with the camera. 64mp gives pictures a clarity like dslr. Ultra wide shot of 12 mp captures every detail and is perfect for capturing a wide shot.The best point about this phone I only had to charge it in the morning,and then I use it for the entire day- taking pictures,capturing moments, playing games like call of duty and while doing all this, I use my Boat Bluetooth Headsets connected with my handset.The battery of this phone is amazing. It really lasts long.The touch and feel of this phone is very premium like Samsung note 10 or iPhone 11.And I really like the color Mirage Blue- it's the mixture of silver and blue.Just one downtown which I found that Samsung hasn't provided any headphones with the handset.Samsung people you should add headphones as well as a good cover for the phone would also be appreciated.All in all I really am enjoying my new phone and exploring it. Just in love with it's camera. It's so amazing.One more thing with this camera you don't need any other camera apps. Samsung has included everything in the camera.Adding furthermore usage experience the phone keeps showing message that it's too hot,and it gloves multi window. Which is very irritating. Also I feel that Samsung could have provided a good processor.

  Used this mobile for about 3 weeks and then writing this review.The mobile battery is very good and long lasting. Normal use for about 1-2 hours a day will only reduces its battery to 5-10% when fully charged.Camera quality is awesome.One shot mode is good for travelling but I didn't used it much.I used the 8 GB variant so mobile didn't hanged at all.Audio and video quality is very good.Mobile is bit heavy but that's not bad about that because if you chose 6000mAh battery mobile it is obvious that it becomes heavy.I think it's worth buying this product.But beware of duplicate products if the outer seal of the box is tempered please return it as soon as you got the parcel, don't wait for anything.Moreover this review is based on my personal experience, and it may vary from person to person. According to my budget it's worth of money.

Both the phones gone by display damage. These cheapest  phone has no durability like whenever your phone dropped  on the floor it has 80% chances that you got display  breakage .But after purchasing  this phone1. i  feel  that this phone is the great competitor  of redmi phones  telling  about its feature . 2. samsung is no more like in past it has  hanging problem in 6 gb 128 gb version, 3. one thing you when ever you will use this phone you can feel  like branded phone.4. Another most important  thing is you can verify most Chinese  people are not prefering to use Chinese  phone which is made in china Also indian peoples  are also not liking  made in india mobiles. So i purchased this phone on big billion days which is cost me around 18499+ 10% discounts + most important thing is a new display whenever i got damagedSimply to say perfect phone you have to try it

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s offers stellar value for money and is arguably the best M-series smartphone under 20k. The phone has a great primary camera, fantastic battery life, a crisp and vivid display, capable performance, and good build quality. The dedicated microSD card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack only add to the smartphone's appeal.The macro lens and ultra-wide camera are also quite average. However, these issues are not huge deal-breakers. The Galaxy M31s is a great package overall and Samsung surely has a winner on their hands.

  I extensively researched for a month before purchasing this mobile. I run a company and I was looking for a mobile which can be with me without any maintenance and slowing down for at least 3 years. I cannot afford to change mobile phones every year and I'm already using an iPhone 6s Plus.I was confused with this mobile, Oneplus Nord and realme 6 pro and finally purchased this mobile.Pros:1) The screen quality is Awesome. it is super AMOLED and no less than the flagship series of Samsung.2) The battery life is the second-best point of this phone. The battery lasts at least 1.5 days even with heavy usage.3) Samsun One UI is also great. There are no ads, unlike MI, Oppo and Vivo phones. It offers a lot of customizations and one the easiest to use.4) The camera is not that bad, the camera is not that good as OnePlus Nord but it is not that bad. It has an average camera.5) No Heating issues.6) It can run games easily. I won't say it is the best at handling games but if you are not a gamer, you can run any game on this mobile easily.7) The speaker is big enough.8) Audio quality is simply unmatched, it has Dolby Atmos and with earphones it is awesome.Cons:1)The biggest Con that no will tell you is - it has no Haptik feedback and also Vibration sucks.2) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is not worth it. It is really bad.2) Plastic back is very bad and you need to cover it to save it from damages.3) No earphones, Screen guard and the back cover comes with the phone. Please get the cover on the same day as there can be micro scratches on the phone.4)The phone is heavy and a bit thick.

  Decent for day to day use but with some irritating issues and some useful functionality miss.Phone has a powerful battery, no doubt about that. Where my earlier phones with 3200 mAh battery used to drain twice a day, this phn doesn't break a sweat it easily lasts for 1.5 day. Although 6000mAh battery increases the weight of the device significantly.Look, Display and design of the phone are amazing. Looks good at both front and back. Gradient bacl gives phone a premium lookMemory management : Samsung does not live up to expectations here. I was using a 6GB Realme 3 pro before this but never had  my phone freeze or hang, but this ""Monster"" by Samsung is not so good to handle applications, I have seen high RAM consumption and device do hang sometimes which is quite irritating given it being an 8 GB memory phoneFingerprint sensor : probably most impactful irritating thing with this phn is the side button fingerprint sensor. It is not very smooth, takes time, since surface area is small, finger misses it many a time, and sometimes if my finger touches it while picking up the phone it gets disabled for 30 seconds or so. Surely never going for side button sensor ever again.Camera: Ohh the biggest disappointment. From the setup which it boasts of quality of pictures is not up to the mark. Night mode is not the best in segmentMissing Utility apps: When some companies are offering many utility features that can be useful, this phone lacks such features . Team can research by looking at some other phones and introduce new features to increase utility.So by the overall review it is not a phone I would buy if I had any non-China product with decent reputation. But since we do not have any other option I think it is a phone I can live with. Hopefully we will have better Indian players in this segment and then we can have some improvements

  The product is nice from its price prospective. Samsung has really gone ahead since last year pushing lot of features in its One UI which also looks great with its AMOLED display. In terms of display I think currently non of the other brands/neither its own predecessor are in competition with Samsung. The phone looks premium because of its glasstic appearance and a slight curve around the front pannel nevertheless the material is rightly said as plastic. Careful selection of tempered glass is essential as to protect the screen. The battery seems to be preety good. Started setting up the phone with allmost 50% took around 5 to 6 hours to complete setting up the phone and the battery was still at 46% and after allmost a day later it is at 38%...quiet impressive. But have to bear in mind even it's bunduled with a 25W fast charging adapter it will take atleast 60 to 120 minutes to fully charged. Let's move to sound, I think the speakers are ok ok type as you maynot feel the quality bit distorted, however with nice set of headphones along with Dolby Atmos plus UI sound settings the sound quality is nice. Moving to the next segment front camera, I felt it could have been improved with indoor shots you can easily she the selfies are whitewashed, there are ampule of options to edit but the major part is how the original image appears, so I am not quiet impressed with front camera. Primary camera is nice indoor shot was good. Need to try with night mode.

  1.Best budget phone under 20k throughout any brand..best thing is its non chinese unlike those fancy companies..Superb camera quality, superb Portrait shots2.Battery life doesn't seem like 6000mah..ita last 1 day easily with moderate to heavy usage3.Screen is that thing which anyone will fall for..feels like a RO water display so much detail so much crisp. Movies with a earphone or good quality sound box feels like theater at home4.selfie is not that great ok ok tye5. Always on display feels Premium6. Daily normal usage feels buttery smooth unlike the gaming in it.7. Main problem is Internet, i feel internet runs slower than other devices8. As my title Little compromise so the compromise is its processor..Too much outdated now..now 7nm processors are coming and samsung still using Exynos 9611 10nm architecture processer which is a little disappointing.. rest is good9. Back panel feels extremely premium if u don't use the back cover but a back cover is recommended for long term premium fit and finish.10. Fingerprint reader fails 6/10 times if u don't set ur finger properly  Don't overthink just buy this phone u will never ever regret this deal for upcoming 1-2 year.. Good luck

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The moment I unboxed this amazing phone, I was in awe of how it was made. It's amazing at all the aspects Samsung boasts. First off, I'd like to tell you about the processor, the Exynos 9611 chip, it's one of the finest from Samsung and is also found in it's more premium and high range 'Galaxy A Series' like the Galaxy A50 and more. Secondly I'd like to tell you about the display, it's mesmerizing is all I could say. The Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen all the more protective from scratches and also buttery smooth. It comes in 6GB and 8GB RAM models and either one of them would perform proactively and at it's best.The 6000 mAh battery is to look out for most in this smartphone. In simpler words. It just never quits! You just have to charge your phone once till 80-85% (in my case) and you're good to go for another whole day and still be left with enough juice to go on about the rest of the day without charging it halfway.The 25 watt super fast charging proves to be a champ in charging the phone at a blazing fast speed, leaving you worriless about the time consuming practice.The phone is a sleek looking one albiet it's also just a little bit heavy because of the insane 6000 mAh battery it consists of. Overall it looks amazing in your hand and it had that head-turning-vibe.Sony IMX68 sensor in the cameras prove to be a supreme highlight of the phone, it can take crystal clear pictures effortlessly. The night mode, the food mode, the slow-mo, the 4K mode, and even the normal 720 & 1080p modes are wonderfully constructed by the software. Like I said, this is a finely crafted smartphone. On top of that the side mounted finger print sensor does it's job simply and efficiently (which also means blazingly fast) for you to nothing but simply 'tap' and bam, you have your phone unlocked.Surprisingly, this phone, though being a mid-ranger model, is protected by Samsung's top notch security software 'Samsung Knox' which, if speaking in simple terms, if you have this phone, you can go about doing stuff on it like you usually do and leave the hard work to Samsung for protecting your device against brand new as well as age old malwares and viruses.

    A great phone to buy 🔥
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I bought this phone with some confusions as it's having Exynos 9611 processor and Glasstic back, but after buying it I'm fully satisfied. I know chinese companies are giving Snapdragon within this price range but Exynos is a good processor for non gamers and day to day usage. It performs smoothly and honestly I haven't seen any lags. And the most important thing is you are geeting the brand value of Samsung.Pros-1. Great Display- Super Amoled display with drop notch makes the viewing experience great 👍2. Big Battery- I'm a heavy user but still I get 1.5 day's battery backup. It comes with 25 watt fast charging which charges it's 6000 mah battery within 2 hrs.3. Brilliant Camera- There is no doubt one would get the bestest camera in this price range. The main 64 MP camera with Sony IMX makes it the best. Samsung's intellicam works great even the night mode and macro camera works fine. And the 32 MP front camera is superb.4. Weight Distribution- The weight of this phone is almost 203 gm. as it's having 6000 mah battery but Samsung managed the weight very good, and it doesn't feel heavy in hand.5. 3.5 mm headphone jack6. Good audio output with dolby atmosCons-1. Glasstic back- if you don't use cover there is a high chance of scratches.2. No TPU case- Samsung should have provided a tpu case within the box but they didn't so you have to buy it separately.3. Gorilla glass 3- It's time to give gorilla glass protection 5 as consumers are paying 19k-20k.Overall one can definitely go for this phone as it's non Chinese and a great deal within this price range. I'm very happy with this phone.

  A pretty decent mobile on its performance,maynot be a choice for gamers but for normal use this works perfectly well.Camera with outdoor lighting is brilliant with natural color production and you can make wonders using PRO mode,need improvements in artificial lightings. Video stabalization is not that great as even minor shake cause a blurry output.Bixby vision and AR zone are too cool.Super Amoled display is a treat to watch,call quality is good,excellent battery,smart view option to mirror mobile screen is good. To conclude, M31s definately stands tall from samsung segment but if it would have been within 17k price range it would surely be one of the competative one in market.

  See in this price one cannot get everything right, so Samsung has offering for best camera, display, and battery in this price.I must say camera is one factor which is hard to master in low price, even one plus struggle to give best cam in 30k.So camera is top highlight, then the quality of display it has. Is surely amazing to this price.The ui experience is surely amazing, if you have never used one ui then it's hard for you to understand but this is best ui, with high level in customisation and top level security.Performance is also good if not awesome. In my opinion it's one of the best phone in its price. One can go with it and I am sure will not get disappointed.😀🙏

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using it for a week And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Fingerprint Sensor:Having integrated fingerprint sensor with power button it feels awesome and works always!!Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  This phone gives a very premium feel while holding. Fingerprint reader is quick which was expected at this price point. I use this phone whole day and still can't drain the battery before sleeping, camera quality is simply awesome 😎, i didn't think it's camera will work this good in indoor lighting conditions and as you can see dynamic range is also very good, i should have taken more outdoor photos to show you the dynamic range but i don't go out much😐, but if you are making long videos phone might heatup a little if you are using any kind of cover, but don't worry, it will cool down if you put it on rest for minute or two.Phone is little on heavier side but considering massive battery it's negligible, you can get used to it😁. This phone suits my needs so, i am giving it five stars🤩.

  Buzzing sound is coming with all audios when the earphones are connected.. I used same earphones with different mobiles, there is no such problem, even the sound quality is great with others.. But with this M31s, the buzzing sound is very irritating.. If you lower down the volume to 1 or 2 , the buzzing sound is same.. I had checked for this problem on Internet and on samsung site. Many users are facing the same problem..2nd problem is, if you are on any app and you just locked you phone.. Then later after 5 to 10 sec. you unlock it, the app got stuck at its place or freezes..The exynos 9611 is very old processor and in this handset it is not optimised well..Also, No back cover is provided in the box.. which is again not well.. I mean samsung is taking 18 to 19k but can't provide a case with this phone..This is not acceptable, you are giving 18 to 19k for this low quality product.. Pathetic..

Overall battery life could be more better if software were more optimised.6) Come on Samsung!At least you should give a tpu hard case for mobile protection. How much one cost? Max Rs. 50!Is it not!😀And yes Samsung what is this ? Again 9611!Although there is no issue with this 9611, as because of your finest software optimization, but please we demand more powerful processor as we are paying almost 20k.However, This one is best under Rs. 20k. And there is no need to think before buying this one, if your budget is under 20k, this is the one for you.Finally to Samsung, congratulations for extraordinary improvement in camera department. Make in India.👍

    All good except battery!!
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have been using this device for almost a month so I will give an honest opinion about my Galaxy m31s.Firstly, about the display, speaker camera I don't have any complaints. All of these are as good as the price of the phone. Moreover the display is quite good.Secondly, about the processor some people have issues. But if you are not a heavily gamer ( like playing COD in highest settings) you can do all multimedia and communication tasks without any problem.The most important point to consider is the battery backup. As this phone have a massive battery so people would compromise on the processor to have a long lasting battery. But don't be fooled by that. Just after setting up the phone I got a system update (October 2020) and since then the battery backup has become very poor like in half day of moderate usge will bring the battery to 50%!! At the end of the day I am always at 30-35% and seriously I don't know if it is normal for a 6000mah battery. I guess Samsung is tweaking the OS to degrade the battery quickly.Lastly as you can see in the given image the camera modules in my device is slightly off set. It is obviously a manufacturing defect but as it didn't interfere with pictures clicked I doesn't bother me. *The camera quality is very good at this price point.*The fingerprint sensor has a clicky feel to it. But is is quite accurate and fast. So no worries there.

  I have used this Mega Monstar for over a month now and if you are confused and reading this comment you will get all your answers, answered.Camera Performance:I will not get into the number but this phone camera is best in 20,000 price bracket in comparison to any other phone in this competitions. The HDR, Dynamic Range all things are captured very good. Sometimes struggle in low night but will do the job other wise.Performance:Exynos 9611 before the launch i hoped Samsung would have upgraded this processor beacuse we have seen this processor in other phones as well but they didn't.But now after using it i don't have any problem with it's performance. I only notice a lag in switching from camera to any other app and will tell you that this processor is good enough for a medium user but if you play games for more than 2hrs. you will see a few lags and then phone performance declines and other than that performance is good.Battery life:(I should tell you that charge this phone at night and then use it for the rest of the day worry free!)This phones gives me screen on time over 11hrs. a day and i use my phone for entertainment purposes like Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video's, Hotstar etc. And it's great at night i usually go to bed with 20-30% battery left.Display:I would have said the best display in 20,000 but now Realme 7 Pro also have Samoled display and Finger Frint sensor in the display which look's cool but is not as fast a Samsung Galaxy M31s. So for display there you have one phone competing with it.Phone does have HDR10 as i haved checked it.If you love to watch your content on you phone M31s should be your pick.Knox Security/Security:Phone does show Knox Security but you will not get all the features of Knox in it there are one or two features that you can use of Knox Security otherwise other features are not visible to you but knox make phone secure very much in comparison to other Chinese phones.Design:I have Mirage Black colour and phone looks very cool. Handling is also good. And other than any other M series phone this phone have a frame ( Plastic one) and glastic back basically a polycarbonate back.Final verdict:I will definitely recommend you this phone for it's Camera, Display, Battery and overall user experience. Once you start using Samsung phones and there OneUi there's no going back for sure.

  After 10 days of use I find no fault in this phone. Camera is of top class, battery lasts almost for 2 days in one full charge; it doesn't take  too long to get fully charged. It gives good feeling in hand. Initially I was hesitating to buy it after going through a few negative reviews. But I didn't  want to buy a Chinese phone so I  went for it. My advice, go for it if you want to spend Rs. 19,000. Although I bought it for Rs 17900 under a sale on Amazon.

  I am writing this review after use of 10 days. Finger print reader response is very quick and operating is hassle free as it is fixed with power/lock key. Battery life is much better but phone consumes battery too much and hence u can expect a power of maximum for 2 days even though it has monster battery of 6000 Mah. Camera quality is just best, may it be rear camera or front one. You won't be disappointed. Its touch is smooth and having quick response. Overall the phone in this range is best but not for heavy gamers.

  I shifted from MiUi to Samsung's One Ui after 5 years and I can see the difference. The Ui is quite Bulky and feels heavy with all the animations (you can reduce them altho). So the fast refresh rate while scrolling through the apps is quite visible. This is the only change I felt that I would rate among the Cons.Would Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a mobile with great camera and more importantly great On screen experience. The screen is just WOW you can't compare this with any other mobile in this price segment. So Non gamers with high battery demand here you go, this is made for you.

    Best phone for moderate everyday use.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Let's make review simpler.Pros:1. Of course, It's a beautiful Amoled display. I loved its punch hole display. Colors are vibrant and brightness is superb.2. As Compared to its predecessor Samsung improved OneUi 2.0 a lot. Its actually a good looking custom skin now with very few bloatwares. It got some very handy gestures and a beautiful Always on Display.3.  Its Battery life is great, I don't see any reason to turn off my data or to turn on battery saver mode.4. Charging speed is not as fast as oneplus or Realme but still Its charging speed is okay. I charged it from 0 to 100 percent in 93 minutes. Fully charging a 6000mah battery in 1.5 hrs is not that bad,5. Fingerprint reader is great, It works well even on  wet fingers.Cons:1. Front camera is a total disaster, back camera is just average.2. Mono speaker is loud enough for call alerts but not for media.3. Like front camera, Face id is useless, It works 2/5 times.4. No Gcam api support.5. A little pricey.Conclusion:Its a little pricey but still I'm giving it 4/5 stars because i was actually impressed with its beautiful AMOLED display, Colors are sharp and Vibrant. There are a few cons mainly related to its camera but like me you want a phone with good display, Full day battery life then go for it. I'm no gamer still PUBG and COD works well on medium settings, Camera performance is great in daylight conditions but as the sun sets its camera set down too.You can gt many better phones under 20k if you want a phone for gamiing but if your primary focus is not gaming, go for it.

  A very good phone overall. But with this cost, I expected a great phone, not just a good one. Processor is ok but could have been better and the camera is not that great in low light circumstances. Overall there isn't much to complaint but there isn't anything great to praise as well except may be for battery which last 2 days. Would have been a great phone for a lower price.

   Camera quality is good... don't expect like Sony, color contrast and senses working good... sufficient for this prize range... actually I was received the product yesterday and photos not captured yet... will be up load after capturing... and O notch display is really good...Finger print sensor is superb working... I was used Samsung A 50 before I bought this, in display finger lock Samsung not working as expected but this side monitoring sensor working excellent and battery life is good cause its 6000mah battery you already knows and its light weight in our hands like freely carries, videos and picture clarity is good as expected and I'm uploading video to show you... totally you will be satisfied to buy it... if any cons I will upload after usage... use the tempered glass witch has i shown you in pics, it will perfectly fit to your mbl m31s, if you want to buy 3d, 6d glass you will regret after usage cause we want pocket friendly tempered glass right?

  Although i was super excited for the product, but after receiving it i was little disappointed for the camera.The camera is not upto the markThe front camera looks like 16mp only and clicks smudgy pics. Plus you have to keep your hand super stable otherwise it clicks blurry pics.The plus point of the phone is it's built quality. Does not looks like it has 6000mah battery. Plus the display is also very good. The side mounted fingerprint button click is not so good, but okk.The processor is really bad, not very smooth.

Its my first time i am using samsung and i have no regrets. Its classy phone. Yes little heavier side but you get awesome battery backup and feels like you actually holding something. You will need to buy cover for it as it can easily get scratches at the back panel.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  A huge upgrade for me, especially when you are replacing old Chinese Redmi 4. The quality of the display is just awesome.  And so is the overall build quality. And you get super fast charger bundled with it. The wide angle camera is also good. The only con which I noticed is that there is no back cover bundled with this package. And since it is a newly launched product, there are not much options available as of now as far as the back cover and tempered glass is concerned. The back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet.The phone delivers an everlasting experience. And I love the dedicated memory card slot.

  I had searched budgetd phone (20-30 k ) for around 2 months and then decided to go with this...decisions was influenced with Indian - China movement too and canceled Nord and ordered this.I am working professional and Mideocare gamer too..1. Screen or Display - 4/52. Typing or keypad- 3/53  Camera - 3.5 / 5 ( 64 Mega is a myth )4. Gaming - Above Avergae5. Speed - Mideocare as expected from samsung processersMy biggest trouble is that it's not property supporting LTE or 4G network. Before this my 4G was working well with previous device on this it's not stable. Surprisingly it doesn't have 4G only mode under network setting hence it's  always picks up or switch to 3G only....attaching picture of network settingIf you are not bothered about cheenese products go for Snapdragon processers only..

  The best smartphone at this price range bundeled with 6000 mAh with 25 watt fast charger ( Using samsung for the first time and loving it).Fingerprint reader is fast. For me battery lives upto 24 hr. If i do my normal tasking and with heavy usage it lives long 8_10 hr. Finding Samsung's one UI core version very user freindly and addictive. Camera quality is very cool. Shoots quality of pictures with proper details and single shot feature is pretty cool. Loving superamoled display

  Fingerprint reader is too bad. You have to draw a pattern everytime. Face unlock is not to the mark.  Battery life and camera are outstanding. But it takes 2 to 3 seconds to capture next shot with this camera. We can't take multiple shots in seconds. It is very heavy and slippery. You really need a back case even if you like it or not. People who have already used a good smart phone may not like it.

  I was happy as I got the phone. Used it for a week. It was all fine.  Then after slowly it started to get hanged. After a month, While I was in a call all of a sudden the screen turned black but the call was still on going. I thought it got hang. So after the call , I tried to switch off the phone, But no response other than vibrations. Then I received another call, since screen got blackout , Couldn't pick up the call. Tried to reboot the phone, nothing happened. I waited overnight. Next day morning , I tried again to do something. But nothing was happening. Thenafter by evening I took the phone to service center , They told the software trashed. They repaired and gave back in another 3 hrs.But I really can't believe that it's a 8 GB RAM and still getting hanged a lot. Soo depressed .Really don't know Is this a 8 GB processor itself. I seriously lost the trust in Amazon for buying electronic items. Please guys... Don't go for this product.

I think for a normal user (like me) it is okey but for gamers it isn't good.

  Honestly, when choosing a phone, I looked at a lot of models, read a lot of reviews. And all models have some negative points along with some positive feedback hence I decided not to read the opinions of ""experts"" and bought this model itself. The main advantage is of course the battery capacity power. The phone itself works smoothly, overall impression is positive. Nice display like that of Amoled. It's very handy. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. The phone works great and presents itself very nicely. I definitely recommend it.

  Writing the complaints only:1.Side mounted Fingerprint scanner is small, thus detection is not as good as the rear mounted or on display Fingerprint sensors, out of 10 trials it will detects 6 times only.2.On normal usage the battery lasts bout 1.5 days & heavy 1 full day, but the mobile feels heavy.3.Colors are highly boosted, not to my choice. In some photos the shades were totaly different then the actual color.4.Samsung Keyboard doesn't provide any haptic feedback. Typing feels bad.

    It's good but you should Look for better processor Smartphone
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I'm using this phone for almost last 2 months so I would say I do know a lot about its performance.IN THE BOX: You will get Your Main smartphone and Charger(with c to c cable) NO BACK Cover so I had to buy a back cover and a screen protection. They should have provided a back cover for a Rs 19500 phone.In short: Build quality (3.5/5) is good but can be better in this price Range.It's weight is less than 200gms so works for me.Screen (5/5) sAmodled of samsung is best.Camera (4/5) is pretty good.Fingerprint(3.5 or 4) sensor is good but slow and its position sometimes makes things complicated.Battery: Excellent (15 to 100 in about 60-70 min don't know the real count but should be really close)Processor: (1.5/5) worst you can get for a 19k+ smartphone.Build quality ⭐⭐⭐ / 5 Smartphone design looks premium with glastic material but in the end its a polycarbonate back you will see fingerprints marks and have to clear it regularly to make sure it won't get scratches (I do use transparent a back cover bcz I love the phone's look)Screen ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 You can't compare other phone's screen with Samsung its sAmoled screen is best in the segment.Fingerprint sensor: ⭐⭐⭐/5 Its good but not as fast as other phones in the same segment. Also, being it a side fingerprint sensor and also a power key you will have some problem but it also acts as a key features of the phone also you can do some interesting things from the key so overall its very good but i would have preferred on screen fingerprint sensor.Camera: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 camera is also pretty good. I have uploaded camera click in 64MP and a macro shot. Same for selfie, So overall camera is good and comparable to other same segment phone.Battery: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ : If I didn't play any game the battery will go for a whole day. In fast charging it goes from 15 to 100 in about 60-75 min I think. I usually charge it before I go to sleep after switching off fast charging mode (fast charging made battery life smaller, go to youtube for more info)Processor: ⭐/5  No good. My friends SD710 and SD712 works better than this. Even my sd660 sometimes play things better than this.I don't play much games(around 1-2 hr/ week) So after 2 weeks I installed 2 games, forget about rpg I sometimes play, this phone started to stuck in a game similar to candy crush (when all bubbles burst after completion) and i do close all apps from recent before playing and it's a 19k+ smartphone- _-So overall i will give 3. 5 or ⭐⭐⭐ to this smartphone as phone is not as good as it should be in this price range.

  This phone is extremely good. I solely bought it because of its excellent Ram management and of course for its amoled screen. I'm not a huge gamer, so for everyday usage the phone performs upto the mark. Below I'll list some of its best and not so good specifications.Battery life is really good. It last a whole day with back to back usage from some light games to videos, music, heavy browsing and hours of calls. So battery is 5/5Camera quality is also quite good. Although it struggles a bit in low light but the overall output is really good. You need to use the ""Pro"" mode (if you're familiar with DSLR) to get the best out of the phone camera. Selfie camera isn't the best out there given the fact that it's 32mp. It's decent enough and intellicam is quite useful. So for camera I'd give 4/5.Ram management is the best out of the lot. Although it takes up a lot of power and ram, the switch from one app to another and back and forth is smooth and consistent. I'd rate full 5/5 for RAM.The display although amoled is a bit yellowish. You'll see the yellowish tint clearly on a full white background. And no it's not the settings. I've tried every settings out there possible but it's not the settings. It has more to do with the phone than the settings. Compare it with some other phones and you'll definitely notice the difference. But other than that, the display is very immersive. Display I'd rate 4/5.Now coming to the downside:Phone is quite heavy. I know, it has a big battery and as a result it tends to be heavy. So to each their own.The screen to body ratio is not the best out there. I'd say M31 screen to body ratio is better than M31s. It has an aspect ration of 20:9. In simple terms, it's taller but not wide enough. So some apps might not work well with that ratio.And yes, if you're ordering this phone, then bundle it with a back cover. It's a must with phones like this.Overall I'm quite happy with the phone. The pros outweighs the cons. And all phones will have its cons. So if you want to buy this phone for its pros then I'd say go for it. It's a solid phone compared to other brands. You'll really feel the difference if you compare with other phones. It's worth buying.

  MY review for a wonderful Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using 8GB M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget. 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using I have not faced any lag on hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Go for it. Thanks Amazon for FASTER delivery.

Camera quality is good but not ""one plus"" good especially in low light settings. However, is a decent pass off3. Very handy mobile. Easy to use.4. Loved the fingerprint scanner.

  After using this phone for 5 days and exploring its every side, firstly I'd like to talk about the design, it feels super premium to hold like any flagship device of Samsung.2. Talking about the display, It just outstands, The blacks are deep blacks because of the super amoled display, play any youtube video in Full HD and you'll witness an immersive experience.3. Fingerprint is super fast, no doubts there.4. The glance on samsung feature on lockscreen makes this phone interesting in a way (Not sure everybody will relate to this)5. Talking about the rear camera quality. It is just amazing, I've attached samples(Normal & Wide angle, night mode) and you can see the quality of the pictures. I'll give 5/5 for it.6. Front Camera performs really good too but in good lighting conditions only. In low lighting it struggles a bit but not too much. It will do a decent job there.7. Battery of this phone is massive. I'm a heavy user and before going to bed at night, I manage to have atleast 30 percent of battery after full day of usage which is quite good.8. Charging time is also very less. It takes around 105 minutes to full charge from 0 to 100. It takes only 20 minutes to charge it 30%. For example : If you plug in the charger at 50% battery level, it will give you 80% battery in just only 20 mins which is quite good especially if you want to leave for somewhere and you have to charge your phone in a hurry.9. Dolby atmos (earphones only), Sliding notification from fingerprint sensor, The speaker sound quality and loudness are some underrated features of this phone.10. I ordered mirage blue because black variant wasn't available but I'm in love with this colour. It is better and more attractive than the black variant. So if anyone was having a doubt regarding this or waiting for the black variant, go for the mirage blue. You won't regret.11. I can actually say for this phone that this is a 'Value for money' product.

  The main reason for me to buy a Samsung phone is its reliability. Have been using for 3 weeks and didn't run into any issue and the performance is good. The fast charger does it job well though I didn't do any measurement. The battery is long lasting. With my low-to-moderate use, it easily lasts for 3 days I think.- I find the phone quite good looking and Inifinity-O display makes it better. It is easy to handle. The back is slippery, so a back-cover is a must.- Fingerprint sensor on the power button makes unlocking phone natural, although one wishes it was a bit smarter (e.g. turn on the screen when *pressing* the power button, instead of unlocking which can be a bit annoying).- I didn't use camera much yet, and am not a pro. So, it's hard for me to say if the quad-camera setup elevates the photography experience to the next level. Tried the single-take and liked it somewhat.- Speaker is good enough for listening to music. Didn't try the dolby experience using earphones yet.- Some of the Samsung Apps have useful features, not found in the stock Android apps I used earlier. I especially like the ability in messages app to select and delete multiple messages. Also, the useful cards and category features are good.- The Galaxy Store auto-installs some apps like MX Taka Tak, Snap Chat (not everyone wants these apps!) and tries to trick you into installing it on different occasions. But, it's not difficult to choose not to.- The phone app is integrated with an opt-in spam-protection service, Hiya, providing a (limited) alternative to TrueCaller.- In terms of connectivity, the only feature I found missing is NFC, although I have never really used it on other phones too.Overall, I am satisfied with this phone and will recommend it. My reason for buying this model (over previous M model) were: bigger battery, fingerprint sensor on the side, and better camera.

  Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG. Also have 6000 mAh battery so you can play games, movies etc. for a long time. So overall it's a very good phone in this price range than other brands. Great battery life, impressive cameras, value for money.Best thing is the main USB of the phone, its 64 MP quad camera, shoots amazing photos and video. Also the front camera is very good. Also no unnecessary ads issues with other brands, have very clean and nice UI without any unnecessary preinstalled apps.

    Pros and cons of Samsung M31s
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  One of the finest phone I've used so far. I was a MI customer but after India China war, and boycotting chinese products, I shifted to only reliable brand, Samsung.Pros-1. Camera quality is best in its category. I had Redmi note 8 pro also, which has 64mp camera. But when a pic is zoomed extensively, pixel disintegration was much higher in Note 8 pro.2. Battery life is super awesome. I can forget charging my phone for 2 days.3. Screen is good. It gives a premium feel while watching videos.4. Structure is maintained so that you can use phone with 1 hand also.Cons1. Side fingerprint sensor makes less touch area available for finger to read.2. Bcz of 6000mah battery, it's quiet heavy as compared to A50 or some other phone.

  I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 megapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturation. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it, u will not regret,  I promise.

  I have been using this phone for a few months now and this is surely a great phone by Samsung. I had bought the Mirage blue variant which I should say give this phone a premium touch. The fingerprint reader just unlocks the phone with no problem at all and the reader being on the power button just makes it more easy it use and doesn't miss the finger anytime. The battery life of this phone is too good as it easily runs a day even if I keep continuously using it ( and I do rough use). The 6000mah battery has got the power surely and the 25w charger chargers the phone in just 97 minutes which is amazing. The smartphone has a Super Amoled display which no question is superb to use. The smartphone has four rear cameras: a 64MP Intelli-Cam primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. The front camera stands at 32MP. The cameras have a lot of functions like Live focus, AR doodle, slow motion and many more. The camera demands a praise as the photos produced are of great quality and clarity. The Single Shot function is something innovative Samsung has come up with. I had heard by some Tech reviewers that the processor should have been upgraded at this price point but I didn't seem to have any problem while using the phone. I am having fun using this phone and for sure this is a great buy for me. If you are looking for a good phone under 20k with a premium touch, great battery life and great camera quality this is the one and thumbs up(Not a chinese brand).

    Dont Get Fooled With Exynos Processor
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Pros:Super Amoled DisplayGood Enough BatterySamsung Brand Value4+1 Camera UnitCons:Exynos 9611 processorGlastic Back PanelNot so super fast chargerVery poor signal receptionSo samsung and some tech reviewers hyped this device somuch. But it doest not live upto the expectations. It has the Sony IMX sensor, but it doest not produce true colors. If i take a pic of a red color, it shows you light orange tint. I was so excited with the marketing hype and bought it. The processor utterly disappointed me. At this price range(below this in fact) other brandings are coming up with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chipset, i still dont understand why samsung imposing their own Shitset to the user. People say, it is good for daily usage, i din even ay high graphical games, u can even notice the lag while switching apps. The processor is a complete garbage.And coming to the back panel, i know they cant provide glass to maintain the weight balance, but atleast it cud have been improved. It is very prone to scratches. It feels as if ur own fingers could damage the back.The Super Amoled Display is still protected with Gorilla Glass 3 while other are using GG5. The main plus point is the display itself. Buttery smoothy(only when processor is that smoother of course).Another main problem is the signal reception, its very poor.Dont expect battery to last for 2 days as Tech People are hyping it. Its just one day battery.And it feels as if its over priced. 16k wud have been a great deal.I bought this with somuch of excitement and simply it ruined me. Ive used it for one month and sold. If you still want samsung and can afford a lil more, go for m51.

Great Super Amoled display, great contrust, great viewing angle.CONS:-1. Bad build quality, after using 15 days back cover got scratches easily, though it looks looks batter , but I think at this price range Samsung have to gone with glass back2. Poor WIFI / CELLULAR connectivity ( LOW SAR VALUE)3. THOUGH IT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH EXYNOS 9611 , but it is now 1 year old processor.

The slow mo video is not at all smooth, it slightly stops intermittently...it is not a perfect smooth slowmo..there is a frame drop in the video, pls check the attached sampleRest there is nothing special in this phone...overpriced for this type of quality....i have bought Samsung phone after 12 years..still they have not learnt to produce good phones.Over all there is nothing to get amazed about this phone...poor quality.Whats the use of buying.

The image quality of the camera is good, its depth sensor and ultra-wide are amazing. I love the single take option of this phone. I am really sad that they don't give tempered glass and mobile case, in this price range all smartphone company gives this item. Samsung should give this item.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s is by far the best smartphone that Samsung has to offer. It is a marriage between the affordability and practicality of the M series with the style and flagship features of the A series. The phone comes with an exceptional Camera, monster battery which has been giving me minimum 10 hours backup with heavy usage in video calls and multitasking.  While most reviewers and gurus are condemning the use of the Exynos 9611, as a verified buyer and a multitasker with heavy productive use, I didn't  find any lag or inconsistency  in the processor.  It has excellent RAM and battery management  . The 9611 shouldn't  stop you from buying this phone as it is a complete package.  Moreover, in light of data breaches and the push for data localisation, the phone comes with KNOX hardware which is unheard of at this price.  KNOX along with the trusted name of Samsung makes this phone the must buy at this price point. It has an exceptional battery, camera,  interface  and security. I really  recommend  this phone to you.  Everything from the charger to the phone is made in India which is important  in itself.

  Its' around 15days of using phone. everything looks fine but Samsung has integrated some bloatware in its UI which will show full screen ads every time you unlock your phone, even ads are appearing during you using your phone. And worst part you can't get rid of them. Samsung must have clarified before selling that they have installed these bloatwares. I have read on internet that even Samsung's flagship phones are having these bloatware installed. VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVE FROM SAMSUNG. IT WII GIVE ADVANTAGE TO 'ONPLUS AND OPPO' OVER SAMSUNG. Till date ONEPLUS and Flagship phones of OPPO doesn't have these types of apps.

  The phone feels amazing on the hand and could visually compete with any higher end phones on the market. Everything is great but a couple of things to note:1. There is only one speaker and it is placed at the worst place possible. Right below at the right hand side corner. You will tend to cover the speaker with your thumb when you are holding it normally, which will completely block the sound.2. The indoor photos didn't produce great results. Some of the photos were shaky and focus was slightly off even with the firm hands.

  This is my first SAMSUNG Smartphone which I ordered on 8th Sept and received very quickly on the 12th even it was a village address. Kudus to the Amazon delivery.Though the M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s good for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during a normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues with battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super AMOLED display…..All these Chinese brand phones though have good Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super AMOLED display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display…..there is a day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super AMOLED display and sony sensor…in Samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power-efficient and smooth for day-to-day tasks and heavy multitasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will at least match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very good especially the camera… excellent super AMOLED display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a good successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100, it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had the same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is good….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side-mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies are excellent-provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid-range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like what normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi-tasking there is no delay at all….hope in the long run it remains the same…I am still a little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by Samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…

No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

    A decent mobile phone(non-chinese) within 21k budget
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have ordered this mobile on 6th August 2020 (prime day sale) and received on August 13th.I'm using this mobile for past one week.I would like to say about the cons first and pros lastly. Its my honest views and opinions.Cons:1. There's no back case provided even for 21k we are paying!2. Camera quality is not good all the times. Only works well for certain ranges. When zoomed bit and taking a pic, quality is very poor. Front camera absolutely ridiculous all the times.3. Battery is not upto the marketed numbers. Eventhough im not a heavy gamer, I watch movies and always keep my internet on. But it's okay to run through your day and 20% battery remains when I hit my bed.4. Heating issues initially. But after few days of usage, we will get used to that. Not that much heat dissipated, but still its there5. Face recognition is not working well. When we are in bright room its working perfect. But its supposed to work in normal daylight. But its not reading well. Disappointed from this perspective.6. Vertical size of mobile is huge and sometimes during call, receiver didnt heard me properly due to the size. Mic at the downside is not close to mouth.This phone comes with many pros..Pros:1. Wonderful display. Can't match this display with another mobile on this segment. Samsung wins by miles when competed with other mobiles.2. User interface. I am a apple user, and I didnt find any difficulty while using this mobile.Samsungs one UI 2.0 running on Android 10 is smooth and pretty much easy to work with. Very user friendly. Comes with very less bloatwares when compared with other Chinese mobiles. But still we can Uninstal or disable when not needed.3. Rear Camera. Single take option is cool. Its very good to have this option. Night mode works decent. Macro shots were awesome when clicked 5cm from object. Live photo looks cool. Overall we have many options to take pics..4. 25 watt Super fast charging. Spot on. It took exactly 100 minutes to charge my mobile from 5%-100%. But when charged without super fast charging, it took close to 3 hours to charge my mobile from 2-100% which is expected. So I would suggest to use normal charging once in a week.5. Build quality is solid even when it's a glasstick. Looks is premium. In hand feel is good.6. 3.5 mm jack is still plus. I always prefer headphone jack while traveling. So its definitely a great addition.7. Wifi calling option, always on display, Dolby atmo(only for headphones) are good additions8. Though Front camera quality is not good, the placement of front cam is perfect and gives premium look. Also when watching movies, it gives good feel of watching without any disturbance unlike water drop notch9. Fingerprint sensor works perfect. Really quick and initially it was difficult. But when we get used to this, its really good and feasible to use.10. Software updates. I read on a blog, Samsung has promised 4 years of security patch and till Android 12. So I believe this and super happy for that.Verdict:Recommended- for moderate gamers, movie lovers, non Chinese brand seekers, battery centric, decent camera quality seekers.Not Recommend- heavy gamers, photography enthusiasts and those chinese brand seekers.

  Star rating : 4.5 out of 5Pros :-I. Battery department is top notch1. 6000 mAh Powerful battery2. 25 watt super fast charging (I personallydon't like charger faster than this as thatwould degrade the battery health rapidly)3. USB C to C charging cable with reversecharging.II. Display : No other brand phone can come close to Samsung one in this category even when it has 60 hertz refresh rate.1.It comes with a FHD+ sAMOLED whichis one of the best and neary edge toedge .2. Infinity O camera cut out looks waybetter than the predecessor's m30 andmakes the phone look gorgeous.III. Camera : considering the price I find the both the front and rear cameras to be quiet good. Front one is a 32 MP camera.and in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682 with an f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.IV. Side Mounted finger print scanner is absolutely quicker & convenient than the under display ones.V. Base varient with 128gb storage & 6GB RAM will surely be more than enough for most of the users. If not then one can always insert a Micro SD card ( SIM1 + SIM2 + SD card type slot)VI. Presence of headphone jack is still an advantage. 😂Cons : -1. Samsung should have used at least Gorilla glass 5 instead of the 3.2. The Exynos 9611 chipset is same as the predecessor's M30. Snapdragon chipset would have been appreciated.3. No OIS or EIS is available for either of the cameras4. No NFC/wireless charging/water resistance rating (I know demanding these at this price point is ridiculous as of 2020, just mentioned to inform )5. Packaging is pretty cheap and biggest con is that it doesn't comes with a TPU case. 😬😬6. Complete plastic body or ""glasstic"".7. Price : It could have been at least ₹ 1000 cheaper if Samsung tried ( within a month or two price is certainly going to get reduced as sales season are also coming😉)Got this phone for my mother and she is pretty happy with it.I would happily recommend it to anyone over any dominant chinese phone in this segment.#SayNo2Chinese wherever possible.

    Honest Review - Very Poor Front Camera Quality inside Room
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Honestly, the selfie camera works too much poor inside the rooms (like a 5MP camera). No AI in selfie camera. If you are a selfie lover, you will be 100% disappointed. Phone doesn't have features like screen recording features, schedule turn off and turn on, don't have much customization. During whatsapp video call inside the room, it feels that selfie camera is 2MP. (TRUST ME). In outdoor it works fine.Very nice main camera.Very nice themes.Battery also gives 10 hour of screentime.

  An excellent perfectly suited phone for me. I have been using this mobile since approx 2 months and i am very well impressed with the overall performance.Firstly, the processing speed, it reaches its expectations as it was mentioned. No lag and no delay and no heat.Fingerprint sensor., i had an issue with it and i contacted samsung support through chat and they gave some workaround tips to rectify and its now working fine after an update.Battery life, OMG..its awesome. Even with 5 percent battery you can still play games, take pics and handle calls for one hour. A full day charge giving one day of maximum usage and two days of optimistic use.Camera..i dont use much but i observed a great quality and better picture.Weight...i have been habituated but its not tooo heavy.Sound and picture clarity is asusually good as they have dolby atmos and sAMOLED screen.

  Hi I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M31S on Samsung New Launch in Amzone Prime on Aug 06 2020 with price of 20000Rs after discount of 2000 . I would like to share few pros and cons after using this for 20 days.Pros1. Battery backup is good minimum 1.1/2 day with excess usage.2. Battery charge 100 percent in 1 1.2 hours.3. Front Facing Camera good4. Display was good.5. Performance was good not badCons1. Fingure Print Scanner is disaster in this model.Fingure print scanner having issue some times It won't recognise it's irritating.2. Fingure Print Scanner is at right side of pannel so it's keep on displaying when u kept in pocket to unlock which will be irritating to switch of display.3. Heating issues identified after a a video call for more than 5 min disgusting.4. Sometimes Network issues.5. No back case & Front screen guard will be given.For an expensive mobile like this one should atleast give a back case.6. Touch problemsI hope this Fingure Print scanner needs an software update I feel but over all better not to go with this model. Lots of issues samsung rectify problems u fooled customers.One more issue identified ...network drops suddenly while using it is confirmed handset issue. Two many flaws in this version hope samsung will soon loose it's reputation. Only one sentiment not to buy chaina mobile I prefered samsung. That's bad idea.

  Everything mentioned by the samsung for the M31s is good.But the basic things which samsung doesn't give, is for the security of apps.It doesn't give any inbuilt app or the features to lock the apps as your all apps remain open for anyone to see through it.Samsung really need to do something about the security features.Remaining, like camera, battery life, fingerprint reader works very good. It gets lag sometimes as of the processor I guess, still it needs an upgrade to make the performance better.

These mid range samsung phones can perform very well keeping in mind all kinds of apps and games, great performance with the 8GB ram. Camera is great but keeping in mind 64mega pixel not waooo. But a great buy for Rs.21500. Thanks to Samsung for such great phones.

  *** DETAILED REVIEW ***It's been one n half month since I got the phone.It's my first Samsung device.I'm quite satisfied with the camera quality and battery life, both perform quite decently.The finger print reader also performs well, however, I'd prefer in-display finger print reader or the one at the rear. Those are more comfortable to use as compared to this one built in power button.AMOLED display is quite nice.Now the UI and Processor. I didn't like the Samsung UI as such. Like there could be little tweaks here and there to improve the experience.It's got Exynos 9611. Now I'm a regular user, there's no heavy usage, no gaming, yet my phone hangs quite often.The Processor and UI matter the most to me and I'm not quite happy with these so hence 3 stars.Note: If you're in hot temperature area and using any video call app or any heavy app, make sure to remove the cover of your phone, otherwise it will overheat.Just experienced it yesterday. The device promted warning, which is good feature. Good work on that Samsung.

Shown in picture tooAnd also it has so faster fingerprint sensor than m31Improvements in one UI as in m31 has one UI 2.0 and M31s has one UI 2.1I'm must tell you it's a good buy due to super smiled display and exynos 9611 I don't feel any lags in games yeah and it's very good from Snapdragon 730g (I own Poco x2 too)in terms of multitasking as it can keep many apps at a time in memory as I am a engineer so that's good 🙂And it's very good buy with super smiled display at this price and more fast charging than m31 which I like much good phone✓

  I bought the phone after  reading reviews.many were there.but lastly I decided to buy.I quite happy for this. I'll explain whyLook: the look is nice.back colour combination  is fine.but its plastic and glossy type.prone to scratches.Display : since its sAmoled. Its awesome.none  can beat it.its really beautiful.Camera : I Don't use much, yet the photos I took is nice. 64 mp works quite ok. but you cant't zoom when in 64mp  mode.also doesnt work in video recording. Front cam is also good.Processor. : almost all review say its old processor. But I never felt any lag.though fb and chrome freezed 2-3 times.its not the processor,but the os I think.cause everything else was working well.only that app froze. 3-4 hrs gaming is normal in this processor.Ram: its 8gb ram version. 4 gb is always free.Battery : its pro in name and con in work. 6000 mah gives less backup than 5100 mah Lenovo P2. It will run through a day.could have been  much better. After 1st sept update the battery backup reduced.this wasn’t expected from #SAMSUNG. Samsung made a buzz and fuzz resulting merely nothin.  As usual battery part is very very bad.and you can say, Samsung has just cheated on customers.     Apps : freez.Don't know why,but all the apps ( I have few apps,I Don't use many apps)  just stop working all of a sudden.  There are many things missing. Like Knox, BixbySamsung pay, NFC. God knows why samsung didn’t give.they wouldn’t cost Samsung much!!  Overall a mere disappointment what Samsung M31S is. I couldn’t return it, also, the on site Inspector didn’t come. Asked me to send cashmemo and imei.and told me,he'll send report.but nothing happe.

  Hi,I am writing this review after using M31s for 2 weeks in all aspects:1. Design: M31s has a plastic back panel with a glossy glass-like finish. It looks sleek but is a huge fingerprint magnet. The gradient finish on the back. The phone is a bit too tall to be used easily with one-hand but does sit well in the palm of the hand thanks to its gently rounded corners.2. Display: The 6.5-inch Full HD+ sAMOLED Infinity O display has a maximum brightness of 420 Nits and an aspect ratio of 20:9. As expected from a Samsung AMOLED panel, colors are punchy and vivid. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent. The minimum brightness, however, is not low enough to read comfortably at night.3. Camera: Excellent camera, Good low light photography. Inteli Cam is just awesome. the performance of the primary 64-megapixel camera is excellent for the price. Daylight shots look detailed and punchy. Single Take shot is a very excellent feature of Samsung App. Quality does take a slight dip at night though. Camera performance could have been better in low light photography.4. Fingerprint Sensor: The side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the M31s is quite snappy but the reliability leaves a bit to be desired. The physical size of the sensor is also quite small which exacerbates the issue. Overall, the fingerprint sensor is good but cannot match the best physical implementations out there.5. Performance: M31s has Exynos 9611 SoC is not the fastest chipset around, it can handle day-to-day use quite well. It tackled almost everything we threw at it – from mundane daily tasks like browsing the web with multiple tabs open and using social media apps, to slightly heavier workloads like editing documents and images and taking dozens of photos and videos. Heavier applications do take some time to open, but not irritatingly so.6. Battery: The main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery, which gave me enough juice for nearly 2 days continuously with medium to heavy use. The bundled 25W fast charger charges took just an hour to take the phone from 41 per cent to 100 percent. In addition to Android’s Adaptive Power Saving feature, OneUI has two battery saver modes, which is very good when needed.7. Sound Quality: After using for hours, I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal-clear bass effect. It was very disappointing that the headphones were not provided with this phone. The speaker quality is not good enough.8. Everything is not rosy though. There is a fair amount of bloatware on the Galaxy M31s. Apart from the usual set of Google applications, OneDrive, Microsoft Office, Outlook, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Facebook, Netflix, and Dailyhunt and many more come pre-installed. On top of all that, it has a few redundant applications onboard such as My Galaxy, Samsung Galaxy, and Samsung Shop. My Galaxy, in particular, is quite bothersome as it keeps pushing multiple notifications throughout the day.9. The setup process is also quite tricky. System got prompted to install several new applications whilst setting up the smartphone. Despite my best efforts to uncheck every such notification, many unwanted apps got installed.10. The only chink in the Galaxy M31’s armor is the amount of bloat on board and the incessant pop-ups pushing users to download new applications. The macro lens and ultra-wide camera are also quite average. However, these issues are not huge deal-breakers. The Galaxy M31s is a great package overall and Samsung surely has a winner on their hands.Thank you Amazon for Safe and fast delivery.

Must say its a monster battery.I am a die hard phone user but still battery runs for 28-30 hours.The charger is another bigger advantage from its predecessor which comes with 25 watt charger.Screen resolution  is perfect. 64 megapixel camera works so smooth. The only drawback is you cannot zoom while using 64 megapixel camera.

The Galaxy M31s sports a 6.5-inch Infinity-O AMOLED display with a hole-punch at the centre. Just like the Galaxy M31 this too packs a big 6,000mAh battery but this time around Samsung has paired a 25w charger in the box.Samsung has also gone with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy M31s. The phone has a ""Glasstic"" back which looks like glass but is actually made out of plastic. It is a fingerprint magnet and picks up fingerprints very easily. The phone runs OneUI 2.1 on top of Android 10. The Galaxy M31s comes with a fair amount of bloatware preinstalled on the device.Samsung has opted for the Exynos 9611 SoC to power the Galaxy M31s. This is a dated processor at this point and you do see some sluggishness while loading heavy apps and games. Battery life on the Galaxy M31s is impressive as the phone lasted us over 2 days with our usage. The Galaxy M31s has a quad-camera setup at the back consisting of a 64-megapixel primary camera. We found the camera performance to be good in daylight. It also has a Single Take feature which offers different outputs after recording a video. Lowlight camera performance was average but the found video stabilisation to be poor.

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable. Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive. Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered. Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

    M31S Best Samsung phone in mid range
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I was originally planning to buy the M31 and found out M31S was getting released.I was worried about bad reviews of camera quality in M31 and M31S has better camera with SONY Sensor IMX682.Bought the Mirage Blue M31S with 128 GB internal storage and 8GB RAM model.It has Exynos 9611 octa core processor upto 2.3GHz speed and the 8GB RAM runs all the apps very smoothly.Has an internal storage of 128 GB which is very good to store all my photos/videos I take and from the social media and also for all the apps I use.The Storage can also be extended upto 512Gb by adding SD Card.It has dedicated expandable memory slot which is a must for me.2 SIM slots allows to use my 2 SIM cards without having to carry extra phone.64 MP Rear camera and 32MP Front camera takes high resolution pictures that look amazing.Display is a Super AMOLED widescreen display 1080x2400.Highest capacity battery, 6000 mAh, in the M series has lasts long for internet/video/audio/calling usage. The included 25W charger makes charging phone very quick.Installed with Android 10 and Samsung One UI user interface.Audio quality is very good, too.Overall it is very good in this price range and have recommended this to my near and dear ones.

  The phone offers best things it can offer you but due to processor and the lack of software optimization it is right now lagging.Brand new phone lagging made me sad. Then I watched few videos and rectified the issue. Didn't see any lag now.You can also use launchers like CPL, Apus Launcher etc and they work flawlessly.For the gaming, it is best as I didn't come by any lag issues. Works flawlessly.

    A monster indeed...
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  An absolute monster for light usage (which the majority use a smartphone for).PROS:A beautiful Super-AMOLED display with deep blacks(check image). And with Widevine L1 certification to boot.Superb 6000mAh battery which lasts me for close to 2 days on normal usage( could last upto ~3-3.5 days on power saving mode)Ultra fast side mounted fingerprint scanner (which is a very convenient location).Camera shoots superb quality images for all modes from ultra-wide to macro.A small punch which looks very cool.A sturdy build which looks and feels awesome. Check out the durablity tests videos on YouTube too. M31s has passed all of them(drop test, bend test, water immersion etc.)Beautiful gradient design which I very much love(check image, btw it looks much much better in person, take my word for it).And Samsung One UI has a lot of useful features like the pop-up mode for WhatsApp and messages (my personal favourite).CONS:The SoC (processor and graphics) is kinda old so you will not have very good performance with activities like heavy gaming. But then a majority of you guys just play for an hour or two everyday so you will probably not have any problems with this. But I would not recommend in case of heavy gaming (This is why I put a star less overall).Also I don't find any inkling of the Knox security mentioned. It's probably there but I can't find key features like Secure Folder so Im mentioning it.CONCLUSION :  If you are a normal user, this phone is the best one for you in this price range. If you are heavy gamer I would recommend going for M51.

  Kind Attention to All Buyers. just  dont go with the positive reviews. I will draw your attention towards the most negative aspects of the phone after using the handset for almost a month:I) Believe me it does not have 6000 mAh battery as claimed by Samsung.ii) Finger print sensor won't work 8 out of 10 times.iii) Face id is very very slow and will not work. Finally you will give up by adding a pattern lock.iv) Samsung and it's authorised service centres are horrible and they are clueless about any of the phone issues and they will keep on seeking time once you visit them.v) Don't buy this phone thinking it has a very good camera.vi) All specifications of the phone are just on paper and not a reality.I bought this phone thinking the set is Indian made and after buying this handset I understood why chinese made phones are still occupying a major part of the market.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I ordered this mobile on 6th and received on 11th. Writing this after 3 weeks of usage.1. Battery Life This phone comes with massive 6000 mAh of battery and fast charging of 25W charger. The battery easily lasts for around 1.5 days with medium usage. It is the biggest plus point of this phone.2. DisplaySamsung phones are known for their display and this phone is no less. It has 1080p display and it will leave you satisfied.3. Fingerprint ScannerThe fingerprint scanner is side mounted and I personally did not like it. Also full sensor needs to be covered to unlock the phone. It is not that seamless as it should be. Sometimes I need to try a couple of times to unlock4. CameraIt has a quad rear camera setup with 64 MP of main camera. I am not a camera person but as far as I have used, I have loved it and the camera quality is really good.For face unlock, the front camera seems to have some issues. Around 50% of the time, it fails to recognize the face even though I have added my multiple looks to unlock. I have used face unlock in redmi note 8 and M31s is nothing in comparison to that.5. PerformanceThe performance of this phone is quite good. I use multiple apps all the time and without any issue or lag so far. I am not a gaming person so cant comment on tht.At this price point, it is one of the best phones you can order, considering the brand, battery and display

    An Okay Purchase
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Samsung Galaxy M31s is definitely a good looking phone, but no matter how beautiful the back is, I would use a back cover. Screen display is good even in sunlight, visibility is appreciable.6000mah battery sounds very good but honestly it doesn't feel like 6000mah in practical use.I am not a gamer but a Snapdragon processor would have been appreciable as there are a lot of phones in the market that are providing Snapdragon chipset in this price.Coming to camera, back camera is good for recording videos or even taking pictures.  Micro shots are appreciable but you need to have a really steady hand to capture proper micro shots.Front camera doesn't feel like 32MP honestly speaking.  My last phone was only 16MP and I really expected better front camera quality especially when it's boasting a Sony sensor. However, I would like to mention that low light photography is appreciable.Storage,  I need a lot of it as I have to store lots of pictures and videos and apps too so I appreciate that there's an option of SD card even after putting in two SIMs.3.5mm headphone jack is welcome as lot of us like to use wired headphones.Samsung could have included am in display fingerprint sensor as that is more convenient for some. Side mounted fingerprint sensor works well, that and the face recognition is quite fast.All in all an okay phone. I hope with future software upgrades a lot of issues will be resolved.

  Initially for setting up it took a bit more time than expected . The presence of Glasyic cover makes the phone quite slippery i had to get a cover for it (samsung hasn't included cover and tempered glass) . I have been using the phone from past 10 days and I'll mention few pros and cons :Pros :1. Battery life is good can run up to 19 or 20 hours but at times some apps drain the battery so much that it lasts for 15 hours2 . Camera is really goodnight mode could be better3 . Amoled displays lets you have an amazing experience to binge watch4. There are some inbuiltapps which may be useful (some are not of use though )5. I absolutely love the focus mode and the blue light filter mode6. The finger print reader is is a great placeCons :1. The phone is heavy cause of the battery2. Battery gets heated up too soon3. It takes about 2 hour to charge the device and not 1.5hours4. No tempered glass or back cover is provided5. The speaker is placed at the bottom which gets blocked if finger is there so gives a horrible experience (in that case one has to always use headphones)Over all I'll say it is a great experience and it is WORTH THE MONEY from camera to battery you have a good experience . One should get this phone as it's worth the money if you are looking for a good camera phone with a good battery .

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It has been about 10 days since I am using this phone. In short this phone is amazing.Pros1. Amazing Battery Backup, needless to say. I used my phone whole day (no gaming), lot of social media and at night watched full movie with brightness and phone volume set to maximum,  still I had about 30% battery life left at night 1230.2. Amazing display, SAMOLED display is amazing and after few days you won't even notice the punch hole while viewing video.3. The camera quality is amazing and pictures taken are also quite good even in artificial and low light. Single shot feature is mind blowing.4. One UI is amazing, I am switching over from stock android to One UI and I have not faced any issues, the experience is also nice and offers lot of customization.5. Build quality also feels premium and i didn't find any issues with that either. Though phone's back is fingerprint magnet which is true with every other phone these days.Cons1. Only con I observed is you cannot do heavy gaming at max settings of the game. For gaming at slightly mid settings you shouldn't have any issues.  I don't play any games, used it only for testing. In day to day life, switching between apps was smooth didn't find any lag in multitasking. If you don't do any heavy gaming this phone is more than adequate.Thats all

  I am writing this review after using M31s for more than a week. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough time.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 megapixel with Single Take feature.PROCESSOR.After using for more than a week  I must say, Exynos 9611 works extremely well.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier.Bang for the bucks go for it.

  Very happy with this phone. Compared camera with my friends oneplus nord and this completely outshines nord camera in every way. Look is also very stylish and great.Phone is just a very little bit heavy, but 2nd or 3rd day, my mind stopped noticing that also as weight distribution is amazing in this phone. Screen and display quality is superb. I bought it for Rs17999 during sale and it's worth every penny.I don't play games much so had no issue with processor. Tried pubg and it was working fine. I have switched from snapdragon 730g phone to M31s, I didn't face any issue using youtube, facebook, Instagram, amazon, curefit, hotstar apps. Didn't find any difference at all.The only thing that made me realise processing is slow is Camera. After you click pic, phone takes 2-4 sec to process it.One-click feature in camera is Amazing. I feel this is Best Camera  under 40K also.Tip: Order back cover the moment you order phone. Not that phone quality is bad, but to avoid scratches on glastic back, you need back cover.

  I always fancied the Samsung M series due to the big battery size. And buying M31s did not disappoint me at all. This battery lasts me and more than 24 hours with normal to heavy usage. Also, the fast charge ensures I dont have to use the mobile while charging which normally I couldnt avoid earlier. The side button fingerprint was an added feature which i wasnt even aware of till I bought the mobile. That proves me being the M series fan to buy a mobile without even checking the all features. The camera is quite good, but I give it 4 star. 1 star less as there is scope of improvement. I have heard the processor of M series is not the fastest... But I am not an avid gamer. But I do play a few games and multi task a lot. But I havent faced any issue whatsoever even with the lower variant of 6gb ram. I just waited a lot to buy M31s instead of M31 only for the display. The punch hole display is way sexier than the other one. I always found M31s to be stock out. But finally I have one and... I M SuperhappyNice work Samsung.

  The Samsung M31S is real value for money at this price. The Chinese competitors for this configuration are higher priced. As far as the performance is concerned, the 8GB RAM gives the phone a real shot in the arm and the phone does not lag. The camera is high quality, though I still am figuring out how to use all the features. Does not heat up when in use.

   Pros:Feels Premium built.Fast processing.Good control on battery usage.Highly customisable.Impressive camera hardware and software.No lags even after installing 250+ apps. (including internal:300+).Very attractive one single take feature. Attaching the pics. (only one video is allowed to be attached; so leaving others)One UI is a big plus. Make the premium feel more live.Very smooth gaming. Absence of qualcom is not felt anywhere.Many more.Cons:Idle RAM usage is aroind 3.4GB. With all my apps, it is aroind 4 GB. This concerns me. But better than other phones.Keeping all the features enabled, consumes battery and comes only for a day. But enabling super power saver gives mre than 3 days.

  After using 40 days,Dont expect too much battery life. I haven't installed any games on my phone, but still I am getting only one day battery life.Fingerprint scanner and face unlock are not up to the mark, especially face unlock.I always cover the speaker with my small finger, I dont like its position.But display and camera are extremely good. You will get many features. Overall I would give 3.5 out of 5

  I was excited very much to see this phone. The phone is overall good and fast as its 8gb ram. but, its getting heat when the battery is less than 30% and also, I have observed heating after adding 2nd sim.Think before buy about ""do you need high battery life"" mobile?.2nd review after 1month usageI am a Samsung customer for the last 6-7 years and purchased almost 10+ phones for me and my family.When I saw the M31s ad on Amazon, I was really excited and waited for a couple of weeks, purchased on launch day. But, I lost happiness within 3-4 weeks only as M31s lost its display while I am in another call.After 10days, I have given the same in Samsung service center, siddipet on 19th Sep 2020, and waiting for the same.its been 14days, I am waiting for it and as per the service center team, initially part was not available and now, they informed it will get repaired in a couple of days.Here are my questions -1. When spare parts are not available, why did mobile was released to customers?2. If Samsung does not have spares, why I should wait ? is it the right way to treat the customer? why not give replacement or refund

  I bought this mobile for my Dad and I asked him about this divice and he told me that he was fully satisfied with it. I too noticed that the screen quality, sound both cellular and media are good. Colour of the back panel is very attractive 🤩 but I wish Samsung would have given a glass back. The best and greatest of it is it's battery life and overall user interface with Samsung's one UI with a very attractive themes. I also noticed that the form factor and enhance feel is good. I also wish that the Samsung would have given the Snapdragon processor but still the exinoss processor is also adecent thought my dad was not a heavy gamer so he was very much pleased with it. I would like to give 4.5 out of 5 to this device.

  Within one month, the screen has gone blank. Frequently gets stuck. Seems to be some issue with software. Made in India but the quality is worse than the Chinese product. Now need to go to Samsung service center to see resolution is any. No support from Amazon. They simply redirected to manufacturer. Pathetic.

    A good phone from Samsung 4.8/5
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after 30 days of my purchase.The phone is quite good and many of the issues in earlier models like battery life, hanging, and heating are fixed.Now let us see the detailed performance.Display: The infinity-O display made the phone rich in providing the output on the 6.5 inch canvas, screen ratio is great with a best interaction.Design: The phone is well designed, but more colors would have been added advantage. Selfie camera is just like a dot and not looking odd. The fingerprint sensor is in the right side of the phone, it would have been a flawless phone if this feature was within the display. However, if the face recognition in use, there is no much use with the fingerprint sensor.Memory: I own the 8GB phone, which may be little high for my medium usage, the 6GB phone is also would have served the purpose. I use 10 to 12 apps actively at a time which includes a trading app, the RAM and octaprocessor are managing them effortlessly.Battery: The 6000 mAH battery is keeping the phone alive for 2 full days after a full charge despite the apps and internet being used continuously. This is the first best part of the phone.Camera: The second best part of the phone, Samsung improved the photography abilities in their phones in recent past.M21 itself is a good camera phone, so needless to mention about the superior M31s. Its simply superb. I have uploaded some of the pictures, you may have a look.Interface: The mobile can be operated with ease with the help of Android 10.0.I would like to mention the messages app in this phone, I like it very much. It provides a down tab ""useful cards"" and within the tab, there are 3 subtabs 'upcoming ', 'offers', and 'finances', due to which you cannot not miss any offer and you will track your financial operations. This may be available in other phones, but not sure. I also would like to mention about the samsung switch app, this made my switch over to the new phone easier.Price: Within almost everyone's budget.Others: The type-C to type-C charger is a great innovation which will be useful in sharing the charging.A set of earphones would have been added asset to the phone. Samsung would have opted out this accessory as this is a Bluetooth generation.Thats it for now, I may edit this review if I come across with any new things in future.Finally, this is the best ever phone I have come across in recent past.Thank you for your time 🙏

    Best mobile in Best price but some upset due to Samsung hung publicity of its features
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Initially I took the decision to buy this mobile by seeing Many Reviews in YouTube only but those people also may missed below points...This is the best mobile i used in this price segment but with few issues.They gave 6000mah battery and 25w charging, it is taking around 2 hours to full charge the mobile, but Samsung company in ADS said mobile can be fully charged in 90 minutes but not possible on time.In June 2020 I purchased Realme 6 pro and used for 2 months, its battery is 4300mah charged in 1 hour with 33w charge they gave and for my usage I got 1.5 day nearly.Then in August 2020 I updated to this New model Samsung M31s which had a huge Battery of 6000 mah, usually we expect more battery life than my old mobile as it is big battery but to my surprise I am getting onlyyyyy 1.5 day with my same usage...I am really shocked of this. So don't purchase this mobile only it had huge battery....Pros :1.Handy Mobile for day to day use.2.Good Camera Front and Rear.3.Good Samsung UI.4.No lags on day to day usage.5.Sunlight visibility is excellent.The processor Exymos 9611 is Medium processor which I compromised in this segment as I am not Extreme gammer.But now Samsung released M51 with Snapdragon 730g processor, its super but if they had implemented  in this mobile its really very good...The following problem I found in it :1.OTG usb pendrive supporting on FAT32 Format onlyyy Not Supporting NTFS Format, but now a days most of pendrives or portable hard disks are coming in format of NTFS only.2.Other small small issues in UI.The above need to be fixed by Samsung...Cons :1.Average processor.2.Missed Indisplay fingerprint reader.Overall I am happy in using this mobile as I have not faced any lags or latches in day to day usage of this mobile.

    A good phone but competition is offering something better.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Lets come to the pros first:1. Great super Amoled display display. Samsung is known for making one of the best Amoled displays.2. Smooth UI. Optimization has been done well3. Camera is really impressive, especially the macro lens4. Ergonomics are good. Weight balance has been done well.5. Sound quality is very good despite having single speaker. It is loud and has good bass.6. No heating issue under normal usage and video streaming.Cons:1. Battery backup not as per expectation mainly due to the dated processor. While doing battery drain test, it performs at par with phones with 4500mah battery with Snapdragon 720G/730G processors2. Despite having 25w charger, 0-100% takes more than 2.5 hours to get fully charged (if your mobile is switched on).3. Dated Processor: This mobile is not for gamers. Processor is dated and might slow down in a year or two. Moreover, this processor might not be compatible with Samsung's future UIs4. Display might not withstand a drop due to Corning glass 3 and heavy weight of the phone5. Competition offers better value for money phones. Realme 7 pro scores better in almost all aspects (65 watt charger, stereo speakers, faster and more efficient processor, battery life almost same as M31s, light weight, look wise more appealing)Conclusion:Considering the current competition, if you want to stick to Samsung, then spend some more money and go for M51 which is much better equipped than M31s (more powerful and power efficient processor, accommodates larger battery by increasing weight by only 10 gms, phone will last 3-4 hours more than M31s, better and larger display, charging time will be almost at par with M31s due to better and optimized processor, may support future UIs and android updates).Alternatively, look for Realme 7pro which offers much better specs and experience at same price of M31s.

  Please do read the complete review of this particular product.I saw almost all the youtube reviews and bases on it i bought this m31s.Every one said processor is out dated and similar sort of information but in daytoday usage it will work fine but the reallity was it it gets stucks in a particular apps but you can switch to other apps and other apps works fine during the lag of that particular app ,it get stuck on that particular app's screen for 5-10 sec but the issue is why does it get stuck or hang in a particular apps like youtube, amazon or watsaap so far among the apps i have used.Battery: on complete charge i will last for 36 hrs on screen time usage wothout gaming just using it for surfing in the phone.Charging: It takes 2hr 52 mins to charge from 8% - 100%, which is too long.Display: No doubt it is good but what we will do with the display when it lags and get stuck while using a simple app like watsaap and amazon.Camera: Front camera is useless in low light it is like a 2 mp cam in low light and in outdoor it does not give too much details phones like oppo f15 is a lesser brand than this samsung but is good to use. I bought samsung for a durable brand but what is the use when it lags from the first day onwards.Wight: I would not complain about the weight because i knew it is a heavy phone as compared to other and thick too. Just because i knew it will be thick and heavy i will not question that.Built quality: Glastic back, its lools beautiful but even with the ear peice sound back is vibrating, i was shocked with all these. Even with the use of back cover it was vibrating in the less volume of the earpeice.Heat: With a normal usage upper portion near the camera in the back it gets bit heated.I am thinking of returing it as it keeps on lagging even it is updated with the latest update.

  **Don't insert sim cards unless you are sure that sim card tray pops up smoothly**I liked the look and display of this phone. I ordered it on i guess 31 august. At first i was impressed. But within a day or two i found certain things weird about it. Fingerprint reader wasn't as quick as advertised. Battery kept on reducing on its own quickly. I thoughts that's normal maybe. The worst part was the sim card tray. It was jammed. I thought it being a new phone so maybe its okay. But once i inserted the sim cards it became totally impossible for me to open it.Customer care service isn't good as well.My sims were stuck. I was fooled for providing technician help twice once 4th sep then on 8th sep but nobody came. Instead, on 7th sep, today, i got a replacement without asking me. I just got a notification""your order is on the way"" a night before. I had to go to a store nearby to get my sims removed from m31s phone. Because i obviously i can't return with my sims in. Got no help from amazon regarding this. It wasn't an easy task.The new phone looks fine and much smoother. I am saying this because i have used two now.So in short, buy at your own risk.You are lucky if you get a product without any damage. If it is damaged then it will trouble you. Constant customer care calls, they will keep you waiting for long, you have to keep repeating phone no. Name address etc on every call for verification. Every time you have to keep repeating your issue with the phone. But finally, i guess everything is sorted. *fingers crossed*

  After using this phone for 1 day, sharing my experience.I think this phone is overrated by many techies. I'm the one who brought this after watching unboxing by many youtubers. Camera is good.  6000mh Battery is expected  to  last for 2 days. But not as expected.  I didn't  even  watch movies or do gaming. Reverse charging  works ,only  with  the adapter  cable.  Will find difficulties  in  setting  shortcuts. Finger sensor  works. Phone is little heavy to carry in  hand .For me it's too heavy  to handle. Coming to  it's one of the main features  that is 25w charger. I felt  like Amazon  has exchanged  the adapter  because  it look usual  time to charge. I didn't  see any difference  in charger at all. Overall I suggest  not to  buy if you are buying  for charger. And also you will  find difficulties  in  carry mobile  in hand as it is heavy.Better go for M31 only if you want to  buy non Chinese  phones like me.

    SAMSUNG M31S REVIEW: Pros, Cons and Advises
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Pros: 1) Display: The display is amazing in its segment, although there are its competitors which boast a 120 hertz displays but are lcds, the amoled display on this phone with a punch hole which is almost the same size as the flagship phones looks good.2) Battery: The battery is the talking point of this phone but this processor and this display are power-hungry, so the battery life that you can obtain from this phone is around 9-10hrs of heavy usage.3) Camera: The other talking point of this phone are its cameras, the primary camera provides us good photos with good dynamic range, although the images might look a bit artificial because of samsungs image processing. The ultra wide and the depth are better compared to its rivals, and the macro camera is not an afterthought or just an additional camera with cheap quality, it produces great images.4) Build: The plastic frame doesn't feel cheap and the plastic back has a premium looking gradient but could be smudged very easily.Cons:1) The weight of this phone is a bit heavy and pit on a case and it will be a bit bulky too which may pose a problem to users with small hands.2) The processor is average but as this phone houses huge amounts of fast ram it feels pretty fast while multitasking.ADVISES WHILE BUYING:1) The mirage black colour is the one to go for In my opinion as rhe blue vacant looks a bit cheaper.2) The base ram and storage options are sufficient for a medium user.

  Pros... everything is a pro in this little boy1. Camera. is too notch. Single take feature surprises you every single time. 64mp image quality is too good even on Zoom.AR zone and  designing your own emoji is fun too. Integrated bixby feature is a surprise.2. Display. From 2011 I have user Celkon,Huawei, Motorola, Sony, Redmi, Realme and Asus.. believe me, no other device is not gonna beat Samsung's display. Once you got used to Samsung display, you can never be comfortable with any other display. Screen is glare free and even under sun it's so clear and bright.3. Battery and charging. 25W fast charging amazes me. Device of this battery capacity 6000mah, it charges in less than 1 hour 40min for me. And still after full day of usage some juice is left. What can you ask for 😊4. Biometrics. Side mounted finger print is pretty fast. Haven't used face unlock much. But found it will not detect your face with accuracy.5. Gaming. I did played pubg with high and hd graphics and with uhd sound effects. Device generated some heat after 30mins of play. May not be a favourable game gadget for heavy gamers.6. Ui. ui is having less bloatware and u can uninstall if there is any.7. Sound. Lackof inbuilt music player is bit disappointment. Dolby audio works like a charm and the sound from the speaker is pretty loud without any distortion.Go for it.....!

But now I can say honestly I did the correct thing of buying m31s.I am a normal user who watches movies listens to songs, uses camera when outside and play game for 1-2 hours.I have a 6gb phone and I have never seen ram usage crosses 4gb. Camera is pretty good. Same with display. Since only 1 speaker sound comes from one direction either right or left. But quality is good. But with earphone you won't complaint.On gaming front I never complained but again I have never played games more than 2 hours in a stretch.I will suggest this phone if the budget is around 19k.

The charging speed is also fast.3.PERFOMANCE:-The explosion 9611 is an old processor but paired with 6 gb of ram it provides enough for heavy gaming.4.DISPLAY:-It is the best I have seen at this price range it looks awesome from all angles. The cutout is also so small.5.DESIGN:-The design is pretty good compared to older m series phones. The glossy finish looks awesome.6.BUILD:-The build quality is also good.

  One of the best mid range phones from Samsung that I came across. I will list down the pros and cons beliw.Pros:1.Excellent battery life. 1.5 days of charge with moderate to heavy usage.2.Screen quality is great. Just loving the infinity display with super amoled.3.Camera quality is good. Both in daylight and at night. Something samsung has really worked upon this time.4.Processor is nice. Felt no lag so far. Played pubg smoothly in HD mode without any issue.5.Fingerpring sensor does the job very well.6.Audio quality is good too.7.Bought the 6GB variant and running everything smoothly so far.Cons:1.With 25w fast carger, it takes around 1hour 15 mind to charge from 15%-90%. But then it lasts more than a day.2.Front camera is good but not great. Cant get everything at this price range!

  Received on 31st August..Camera is really good..Display also attracts alot with beautiful colors..Battery life is ok ok..Not supper long lasting 6000 mah..runs same as other phones having 4500 - 5000 mah..Fingerprint sensor really good one..UI is also very user friendly.. About processing not at all recommendable at this price range..Samsung should grow up. Realme 7 is launching at 17000 with 8 gb ram and super fast charger 65 watts something and super fast processor..I'll not say bad but not also best as advertised to attract.. i've been using redmi note 4 since last 3 years.. This phone is not bad but makes feel like not durable..processor not at all good one..for fast processing i bought 8 gb variant..processor they call octacore which can process 8 things together and I'm multi window video calling person so if vmone app video call is running then doesn't work smooth with other app. My 4 gb ram quadcore processor redmi note 4 worked processed better than this.. Honesty not that satisfied at this price range that I've paid.. No complaints or defects..piece  i received is good.

    Best phone to buy in Mid range category

  Samsung M31S, as name suggest is really monster in terms of performance..I am writing this review after using for more than 75 days. During this time, not a single occasion my phone hanged while using multiple applications. This is the big advantage over the rival. Secondly, battery performance is unbelievable. I am heavy user throughout the day due to Work from Home situation. However, I am able to use phone without discharging throughout day till midnight. Thanks to my 6000 maH battery. Thirdly, camera is the USP of this phone especially  Monster Shot. Earlier, I used different brand phones with best camera quality but no one can match the picture quality of Samsung M31s in mid range smart phone category. Weight of the phone it is fairly managable. I must say, if you are looking for phone with best picture quality, huge battery backup and ofcourse descent prize below 19K, then it is best phone to buy...And during Amazone sale, u will get prize lesser than expected...so try to grab opportunity to buy this Monster during festival off season.. Overall, really happy with the Samsung M31S....

  After so many previously samsung phones disappointments...still I purchased samsung m31s mobile phone..and really trust me.. it is worst.. from 1st day it is giving me so many issues..1.sometimes while playing music or video loudspeaker or earphone's sound is switching off..only sound is coming through mobile small micro speaker(which is near by front camera)2.not convenient to type anything because typing board is not that flexibly accurate.3. You can't put screen tempered glass and mobile cover at same time.mobile covers are putting tempered glass ahead.4.it has old processor. Don't expect gaming experience on it.5.samsung customer care was best..but this time when i contact with customer care. They were like..it's may be due to third party app..please restart you mobile(even i told them..if i restart the mobile,the issue is getting resolve for some minutes..after that getting same issue)So it just a product which looks cool but in actual it's  a waste of money.Samsung ka jamana chala gaya hai..i thought firse aagaya...par me galat tha..😅

  Pros-Very good display considering the price range.Camera quality is good.Battery life is decent.Cons-Finger print sensor is pathetic, worst I have ever experienced.Cannot find how to call directly from default sim, it is everytime asking for the Sim 1 or sim 2. Changed setting numerous times, restarted, dis everything I could for no avail. Irritated choosing sim everyone.I've been using Poco F1 for last 20 months, speed is no match.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This phone is a powerhouse.The charge goes for 2.5 days, with using simple apps, e.g YouTube, Whatsapp, Amazon.And goes 2 days, for some heavy apps, games.I have another galaxy phone, Galaxy Note 9.All the software features were same, to my surprise.The display of M31s is even better than QHD+ of my note 9.A bit disappointed with processor, its only 15th day and it has started to get a bit slow. E.g Jittery when you scroll down notifications.Camera quality is decent. Another show down is when switching between lenses, it really gives a slow switching experience.Charging is at good speed. Like 1 hr to 80%.

  Bought this phone, the day it was launched. My requirement of a phone is limited to calls, chat, browsing, battery, watching videos, music and sometimes gaming (gaming not being a top priority).Pros:The phone offers a huge display, which is great for watching videos. With decent usage the battery will easily last for 2 days. Finger print sensor is also decent. OS is also good. The phone is fully charged in 1.5 - 2 hrs. Storage of 128 GB is more than sufficient, have already downloaded lots of movies and TV series and still have plenty of space leftCons:If you are looking for a good camera phone / for gaming purpose, don't buy this one. The phone boasts of a 64 MP cam, with the output or resolution of just 2 MP. Very pathetic camera. The processor is also not great. Imagine, non-heavy apps sometimes don't run smoothly at times.As I sometimes  enjoy taking pictures, my only disappointment from this phone was its camera. Apart from that, this phone suits my purpose perfectly. Although priced at 20k (when I bought it), the specifications  and features  are worth not more than 15-16k INR

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  To be honest it is OK phone. The fingerprint reader is not that great, the camera quality is OK you can get better camera in vivo or oppo which are Chinese brands. The phone came with a charger that can only be used with a c-type to c-type cable you cannot use the charger with a USB to c-type cable. No headphones, no screen guard, no back cover nothing in the box you will get the phone, a cable and charger which is huge drawback compared to what the competitors offer. The 6000mah battery is a joke gets discharged quickly.

  Phone is good for casual users but I noticed few lags while using day to day apps not gaming apps.1 while ringing display take few seconds to show someone is calling i never experienced this with my other devices.2 The single take feature only captures videos no images like you showed in the add. If any settings has to be anabled not sure.3 processor is way to old which does not justify the phone this new, with many offerings other than the important one.4 we understand you are a brand but if you can offer many useless things in the phone why not offer things that really matters like the Chinese brands are doing.5 Camera, Processor, UI and build quality thats the only thing we as a customer expect and chinese brands are offering these and now they have captured almost 70% of indian midrange smartphone industry.6 We don't want to buy your phones just because India china clash like I did, we want the Samsung thing like you were once when you entered in India remember?For this phone 3 out of 5 I wish i could give moreThanks

  This product had made me fall in love with the Samsung for the first time.It has much more than the simple specifications. Below is list of thing I loved in this.1. Awesome battery provided with a perfect battery saver. I managed to work it for two days on more than regular usage.2. Smooth touch response and immersive colors3. It has Knox security or atleast a part of it.4. I recommend to view a YouTube video of its 40+ features before you make a decision.5. Best of all is the contact management due to easy access to groups organizations job etc. Filter.Only con is the processor that lags a little while gaming. Which is not much of a bother once you weigh in the awesomeness!

  I find the fingerprint sensor a bit messy. It doesn't recognise quite a lot of times.Rest all hardware specs are too good.One problem exists though maybe from the software side. When any app is showing any advertisements or there is a sort of video clip in any app the screen flickers. This happens generally when I try to open the the Recent Apps and then again come back. First I thought it was an app issue. But there's no particular app causing this. It happens for all.The camera is super. Battery life too good.

  Things I liked-1. Samsung Dual Messenger: I was missing having two WA accounts on my previous Readme 6 Pro. Very pleasantly surprised with this Samsung feature. I don't know if this is a feature on other phones now, but I am seeing it for the first time.2. Bluetooth keyboard connectivity: I have a portable external keyboard, which I like using sometimes. With my earlier phones, I used to see a keypress lag, but with the latest Bluetooth 5, that lag is gone. The keyboard usage is amazing.3. (Just ordered an OTG cable, so not yet tried). Seeing the keyboard function improve so much, I am now looking forward to connecting a wireless mouse too using OTG. I am hoping that works too - will post an update when the cable arrives.Hope the techies reading this will benefit from this review. I am not a gamer or a photography enthusiast, I am sure these features will meet my requirements. Others have already reviewed these features in depth.

  Its a must grab, worth every penny you pay. Touch is as smooth as it can get, classy in hand and powerful features. Its battery life is great, with extreme heavy usage battery lasts more than 24 hours and camera works wonders, specially the night photography mode. Camera captures every small detail. Dolby atmos sound system is another add on and will never have to worry of space crunch. Face recognition and fingerprint unlock works realtime quick :)So far, no cons faced but then I have been using it for 1.5 months only,  will update review if any difficulty faced in future!!

Phone is not about Processor or RAM . It is about  How much Optimization is there with whole Processor and RAM  and the Software.  Which I think Samsung has done a very good Job. None of the tasks seems Laggy.

  I would like to tell that I had bought this phone and it was over-heating. Then the phone was not accepting touch. I went to the service centre and they wasted time and I was made sit there a complete day. The lawner  they provided was of no use. Then they told that the spare parts are not available and hence provided coupon. I went to the shop but they were not having m31s or other phones. I asked if there is any other shop then they told no other shop is in this city. I confirmed it from customer care, they told 3-4 places. I went there but found that the shops mentioned did not accept coupon. Then I asked the numbers for shops which accept coupon in other cities. The contact nos. they provided were all invalid. Then I mailed to the company so that I could use the coupon online but the company said that it is against their policy. I am feeling completely cheated and forced to purchase a product of more cost even if I don't like it or it is out of my budget.

  I had ordered this phone for a friend. From the moment of unboxing there were a lot of issues. Most importantly there was a specific audio issue that i looked up on the internet and found other users also are facing. There is a strange noise in the 3.5mm slot. Amazon was contacted for service personnel whose service was poor. he saw the phone was defective yet filed the report with amazon that all was okay. again a request was made for another service person which turned out to be the same as the previous person. this time he filed a report saying replacement needs to be sent. which took one week to come. Same issue with the replacement set. I sent it back which took more than 7 days to go to chennai from bengalore. where the phone was delivered. Still no money reflected in the bank account as i had purchased it on credit card. probably the worst experience ever with a phone.

  Where do I begin.....the phone has so many good things that the few major faults that it has can nearly be overlooked. The fingerprint sensor works extremely well even through a case, as for the camera,the camera is not built into the phone, the phone is built onto the camera with extremely good night mode,hyperlapse,super slow motion and extra stable video recording, what else could one want, it has some helpful features for my wellbeing like wind down(greyscales the screen),blue light filter etc. It ensures my usage does not affect my health. Overall a very good buy the only problem I have faced so far is its unusually short battery life for 6000mah out of the box, but it can be rectified but putting apps in sleep or deep sleep categories,to top it off it comes with McAfee anti-virus.

  I switched from using Redmi to Samsung and as soon as this phone launched I knew this is very competitive. The user experience is far better than Redmi phones and you won't be missing out on anything as it is loaded with features. I liked the One UI better than MIUI. All in all if you don't want China this is the go to phone for you. Here are the pros:1. Superb Camera Quality. Stunning front camera. Facilitates Video calling with high quality.2. Very fast processing. Good for a normal gamer. Doesn't lag at all. Ram utilization good. Fast switching between apps.3. Battery backup is amazing. With moderate usage you can do 2 days. If you wake up charged with 100%, by night it is about 50-60 left.4. Display quality is amazing with super amoled screen. The display quality in itself makes the phone look premium and you will love everything you see on the screen.5. Fast charging. My phone charged from 0 to 100 in about one hour. Reverse charging also works well.Cons:Only one so far. While using Snapchat, the videos lagged slightly. May be it is the app issue since everything else works like wonder.

  The Samsung M31S, is truly a monster category mobile phone which has amazing battery backup, great storage space and way awesome camera and its features. After a full charge, the battery drains out to 12% after 38 hours and during these hours my GPS, Internet & Bluetooth stays on. I’m using an Airtel connection and the area where I live in has network connectivity issues and the network bar keeps on fluctuating from 2 to 4 lines all day still the battery works for amazing period of time. Coming to camera, the 64megapixels gives amazing shots, the macro depth camera captures quite intricate details and selfies are just too good.

    Review of a one Month Old Samsung Galaxy M31s
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  As the name Suggests it is a Monster, Here we are talking about The Samsung Galaxy M31s, I bought 1 month ago. My handset is a 6gb, 128gb variant in the color mirage black. Handset is quite Light in weight despite having a big battery. Battery backup is the main highlight of this Phone. As 6000 maH is enough for at least 2 days when once full charged. Talking about its rear mounted fingerprint scanner , it's really fast like a Cheetah. And not at all clumsy,and easy to access. Now Coming on to the camera,  The quality of the rear 64 MP Sony lens is quite astonishing. With the unique feature of intelli cam in which you can click 8 different modes of a Picture/Video in the same time. I think More improvement is required in The macro lens as the pics clicked by macro lens were not that upto the mark. Also the 32MP selfie camera clicks good selfies but lags the Clarity and precision in Dark. I m not a Gaming person , so for me the Processor of this Handset is wiking fast and smooth. In a nutshell I can say if you are a person going for #Boycott Chinese products and you want the quality of Samsung by spending a little more. You should definitely go for Samsung Galaxy M31 S for the Mobile Phone under ₹20,000.

The new Galaxy M31s sports an Infinity-O display and the Single Take camera feature,The Samsung Galaxy M31s is the successor of the Galaxy M31 and brings new features to the segment. The Galaxy M31s sports a 6.5-inch Infinity-O AMOLED display with a hole-punch at the centre. Just like the Galaxy M31 this too packs a big 6,000mAh battery but this time around Samsung has paired a 25w charger in the box.Samsung has also gone with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy M31s. The phone has a ""Glasstic"" back which looks like glass but is actually made out of plastic. It is a fingerprint magnet and picks up fingerprints very easily. The phone runs OneUI 2.1 on top of Android 10. The Galaxy M31s comes with a fair amount of bloatware preinstalled on the device.

    A Monster to Disrupt the Monopoly
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Hey Guys,Extremely good phone, with beast of battery. With my usage lasted for 2.5 days. It will last longer if the app management is corrected a bit, which can easily done via software patch. I am sure Samsung surely will improove!!Easy to handle with the classic ""GLASSIC"" finish. Handy phone with nice edges which fits into my hand.AMOLED INFINITY O display support 4KHD videos which is awesome. where it gets really aweosme when we use Dolby feature.Plus liked the feature where Notifications are displayed as pop-up. Lobe the new UI.I am sure with the price tag, this beast is definitely going to disrupt the monopoly what its competitor has to offers.A best to look out for..!!! Very HAppy with the device.

  SPELLBOUNDThe above-mentioned word might not do a lot a lot of justice to the performance and value that this little device offers.I am writing this after using Samsung M31s for 15 days. Not a long time frame of usage but I would want to share my experience about this little monster(samsung didn't pay me btw).First of all, Exynos does not disappoint.Camera is top notch with intellicam feature that ensures that all the beautiful or not so beautiful moments seem beautiful. It will impress you no matter what.6000mAh battery will keep your phone going for atleast one and a half day if not more, with normal internet surfing and youtube viewing.Phone is very snappy owing to the 6 GB RAM(though 8GB is also available) and 128 GB internal storage.The wait is over. Samsung has, finally, come up with a competition worth handset that can give a tough fight to the existing chinese phone makers.More importantly,  it is Made in India.Blindly go for it if you want a smartphone under 20 k. I bet it will be more stable than your ex gf/bf.Cheers.

  Always had complains about Samsung phones as they were never value for money that other Chinese companies used to be but when I brought A51 early this year my perspective completely changed. The experience with it was soo good, the screen, the safety and the feeling of using something superior.. unfortunately the phone got drawn and then I had tough time to find equivalent phone under 20k and then came M31s..It gives the same feeling that came from a51 with more features to add and few features were lacking but that don't make much difference. Its a battery moster and so is the complete value for every buck I paid... My next phone will surely be Samsung for sure...

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after few days of usage.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 25W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- App lock is not available. You need to download app lock form playstore.-single take camera is working good enough but most of time it take only 3-4 pics and 2-3 short videos.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  1. Battery lifeI continuously use whatsapp, instagram, music, youtube and browser. The device takes 30 to 35 hours to go from 100% to 3% .As soon as I start gaming, the battery begins to drain rapidly. Continuous gaming means device won't last for even 20 hours.2. SoundSound output of mono speakers is good. Becomes too loud at full volume. Impressive.3. Camera (not explored all features yet)Full resolution photos are impressive. Various features and options available to suit your need.4. RAMPretty fast. Been using for almost a month now.Switching between apps is smooth as butter.Overall: RECOMMENDED if you are looking for a budget phone to be used for 2-3 years.

   M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed performance"".  ""'A Gorgeous Display'"" .I. Battery department is top notch1. 6000 mAh Powerful battery2. 25 watt super fast charging (I personallydon't like charger faster than this as thatwould degrade the battery health rapidly)3. USB C to C charging cable with reversecharging.II. Display : No other brand phone can come close to Samsung one in this category even when it has 60 hertz refresh rate.III. Camera : considering the price I find the both the front and rear cameras to be quiet good. Front one is a 32 MP camera.and in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682 with an f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.IV. Side Mounted finger print scanner is absolutely quicker & convenient than the under display ones.(Most importantly presence  of headphone jack is much good work done by samsung 🤣 ) Their is no need to invest in high budget  bluetooth headphones.THIS PHONE IS JUST PURELY FOR INDIAN CONSUMERSSAMSUNG I REALLY  HAS APPRECIATE FOR THIS DEVELOPING M SERIES OF INDIAN CONSUMERS .

  I have been using this mobile for 15+days he i have listed the pros and cons as my usage,I came across 3 smartphones Samsung,nokia and now samsung, i upgraded my nokia 6.1plus which is 2 years old....comparing to that mobile this mobile is double the worth.Pros1.Its displayIts the best display i have ever seen,my friend has the pocox2 which is paired with lcd x 120hz but this is best ...lcd 120hz is just a myth m31s display is buttery smooth.2.The battery .Its is giving 10 plus hours screen on timeIm a movie freak. I spend  most of my time watching movies and series and also spend 4 hours in google meet and upto 2 hours of pubg...all this in single charge i charge it only on the next day morning.3.Charging speed ...the charging is not super fast but it charges from 0 to 100 in 1hr 48 mins.4.cameraThe main cam is mind-blowing in day light and the night light is better than thw poco x2 but it can't be used anywhere.5.wideangle camThe main cam and wide angle shots have matching colours in sometimes both look great.the wide angle night mode is simply waste.6.The con material 9611 CHIPSET:9611 IS not the worst and its not the best, but its a myth than 9611 sucks , surfing through insta,fb, youtube ia buttery smooth.7.GamingAll games are running same as like its other competitors it may open after a 5sec delay that's the only change but it gives constant performance from start to endPubg cam be played smooth+extreme to Hdr+High but its not playable i have 6/128 varient. Smooth+ultra and hd +high has no problems8.The one ui. The phone is looking smooth and flappy becoz of the ui on top of it.The problems with its competitors like the redmi and realme are launching the successors within 3 months so there is no valuable updates for the mobile but samsung is taking good care of theri mobiles in updating it.The cons:1.No gorilla 5 protection.2.Dolby atmos only for the headphones3.selfie cam is not upto the mark.4.macro cam is totally waste ,the 2x zoom in main cam is way better than the macro.5.High sar valueThe verdict:If u are the one who plays games for hours and hours go for Snapdragon like 720g and 730g ..but if u are an average gamer who plays pubg for 2 hrs in a day it has no issues.Don't go for higher refresh rate lcd display the sAmoled experience is mind-blowing.If u want a mobile for long term use. just order it.Im completely satisfied.

  I ordered the phone during Prime Day sale and delivered quite early on 9th August and since then I am using it. The 6•5 inches super AMOLED display make this phone special with wide angle viewing having full screen ratio due to infinite-O- display. The phone's side fingerprint unlock is very much faster. Even face unlocke is much faster. The massive 6000 mAH battery gave me the pleasure of using it fearlessly for the whole day of continuous use and even then 30-40% battery life remain. 64MP quad camera with single take feature as well as performance of selfy camera is quite amazing. Even camera's night performance is impressive. The Exynos 9611 processor works with super fast speed as I have not experienced any lag in the phone while playing the games. The added beauty is it's reverse charging facility as well as 25 watts fast charging support. the phone gave me the experience of theatre like sound quality. This is the best phone in this prize range having the feature of costelier phone.

  Samsung Galaxy M31s is a best phone in mid range. It is a super economic phone which has features like premium phones of high range. I am using it for a week. It comes with 64+12+5+5 MP Rear Camera which takes best in class shots. Its 64 MP camera has really good electric image stabilization and Sony CMOS senser gives crisp clear shots and 4k recording at 30 fps. Its signature amoled screen is really awesome. It holds a 6000 mAh battery which gives power to your phone whole day long for gaming, watching movies, playing songs and so on. It's processor is really good. It charges really fast with the in box provided 25W charger. Speakers are really good and Dolby Atmos supported with headset. It's really a great deal for getting such amazing features for such amazing price. It is like paisa wasool phone for me.

Also, I can doing heavy gaming without any lag or flaw till date.The display is super awesome even in sunlight and its a nicely balanced mobile phone even though it weighs 204 gram.Its value for money for any mobile phone between Rs. 20,000 and the most important aspect of this phone is that it is a non-Chinese mobile phone without any unwanted applications and bloatwares. And its completely MADE IN INDIA just like my Samsung J7 2016 edition.Indeed a PAISA WASOOL mobile far far better than Samsung A31.

  I have been using this phone for more than a week now. Overall average phone with a big battery.Battery: having 6000mah is a huge pro for this it lasts more than a dayFingerprint scanner: it is ok I can say, some times it won't read properly we need to try 2-3 times.face recognition also the same it won't recognize fastly it takes some time.Camera: Camer is good, single-shot feature I liked most, as it takes different modes of the photos.  but t takes some time to open the app. When I using Snapchat it won't work that smooth as my old phone(one plus 5) does. it stuck and can see the lags. Being a better sensor it is expected to work fast and smooth.It misses the feature like disabling data for the app, it allows only background data restriction.

  I was looking to get a new mobile  since  last 2 months.  Wanting to  not buy anything duplicate  or copy phones and keeping the budget at par,it was a difficult decision to make. Research done Samsung was the obvious choice.  M31s been the latest entry I think the wait has been worthwhile  The quad cameras at the rear are a treat.  Keeping the fingerprint sensor at the side is an intelligent  and ergonomic design  Smooth bevel edges  and the mirage blue color  give the phone an  elegant look.  It is true value for money.  Speed and responsiveness of the application justify the 6GB RAM. I  would say go for it with eyes closed.

  Pros -1.Display is awesome one would love this.2. Camera quality is very good.3. Side Fingerprint scanner work very well but it takes 2-3 days to get used to that.4. Have some super cool features such as Blue Light Filter, Music share (Can be used only other phone has similar feature)Cons -1.Processor is very slow. Even one plus 3, 4 years old phone processor was super fast as compared to this one. Probably Ram management is not that good in this phone.2. You cannot remove some preloaded apps in this one even if you want to.3. A bit bulky and thick and after adding cover you may find it as ok ok phone.4. Had to add Nova launcher for customisation. One UI v 2.1 is not that cool if you have gone through using one plus Oxygen or Motorola stock android. One cannot change the opening of apps page from Horizontal to Vertical. Finding the app becomes a bit issues.5. Selfie images are not real and seems one has done some makeup to make them better.

  *Detailed Review *Ohkay so in am gonna start with saying in regards with people who want to buy this phone for gaming purpose.So i would recommend  that please look another phone for that because  exynoss is not made for you .Then i am gonna talk about camera.As per a phone worth 20k camera is not worth it in terms of low light images.Talking about Security so i havent received any knox along with it not sure how other people said that they got one. But this phone do have a huge amount of unwanted applications  and UI is not as great as expected  but decent.I am huge huge disappointed with battery life because its draining really fast.Like when i started writing this with usual speed i have seen 2 percent reduction in battery  and my phone doesnt even have many apps its just whatsap and insta nothing much. Still not sure why is it draining.So maybe a scam with 6000 mah branding.Design is decent but indisplay finger print scanner would be appreciated.Because side mounted is slow and dont even talk about  the face unlock.Display is massive and amazing. Sharp colors and pretty amazing display but not sure if i drop it someday then whts gonna happen because its just corning gorilla glass 3.Looks like Samsung is living in 2015.No headphones  no tempered no protection .This is wierd. I mean  customers can atleast expect something out of box insted of charger and sim ejecter tool. Like common. Atlest give us temprory sim protection  .Because it can get scratched so easily .Please Samsung think about customer a bit....Final verdict.Phone is good enough for people like me who are just gonna use social media and netflix on phone and a decent camera use.Please dont expected something else from this.

  * Display (4.5/5) : Super AmOLED. Rating : 4.5/5 for not having higher refresh rate.* Battery and charging (5/5) : 6000mah massive battery charges at 25w in-box charger, takes around 80-90 minutes for 0-100% at phone switched off. Provides around 8 hrs of SoT.* Processors (3.5/5): Exynos 9611 (10nm, 8 cores, 4 at 2.3 GHz, 4 at 1.7 GHz). Not suitable for heavy gaming. Good for average user.Built (3/5): Plastic frame, plastic back, Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at front. Back is glossy, feels oily, and fingerprint magnet and gets scratched easily with coins, key chains in pocket. Samsung should provide backcover in box.Camera (4/5) : Sony's IMX682 noticed to be improved that from M31's Samsung sensor. Lacks details at low light and cropping.Overall good phone at this budget.

  One should definitely go for Samsung M31s, it's made for the young generation and you won't regret this purchase. The fingerprint reader on the side is pretty fast and does not hamper the design. Camrea clicks amazing pictures, esp 64mp and the singletake feature (I've attached some pictures taken in daylight and dawn).You'll love the colors. The in hand feel is very satisfying. And the biggest pro is the mega Battery. I am a decent user and the battery lasts almost 2 days in one complete charge. If you're looking for anything around 20k, go for this one.

HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.

  Samsung is one of the branded company in which we can put our trust.I am writing this review after using m31s mobile for almost 1 months and I have find best experience with having some problems.Display=> in word ""WOW"" display is wonderful i never had such a good experience with Such a good Display.Battery=> battery backup is so good but can be still be better with updates. Because samoled display consum more battery power then any other display so it can be still optimized by updates.Camera=> rear quad camera is wonderful with intelligent camera features, it gives advice to use camera features to take appropriate shots. Front camera is good but not very good because in low light and portrait pic gets disturb. While taking shot with night mode it take time to load pic....This problem can be fixes by updates.Processor=> who says this 9611 Processor is bad it is good i feel lags but you can't still recognize with your daily use. If you are thinking that snapdragon processor are good than 9611 ,then is not bad for daily uses, if you are heavy gamer then this phone is not for you but moderate gamer like playing some times then will not trouble you.Connectivity=> first of all it support dual sim volite with 4G and network connectivity is also good.Storage=> I have 8gb and 128 gb variant. I had open 38 applications at a time but I didn't find any hang or lag it was working smoothly. But while having 128 gb......26 gb will be occupied by system so I feel optimization has loose somewhere.Speaker=>wow speaker is amazing with clear audio. But while having voice conversations and if we put call on speaker then mic will create problems and my voice is not reaching to appropriate clearance. But this can also be optimized by update.Body=> body is not too strong but it is durable for use. Not heavy ,weight distribution is quite good in this phone with carrying 6000mah battery. If you feel that scratches can get at his back side then carry mobile with backcase or get laminated over back side.Security=> if you ask me for secured phone under 20000 then it is most secured smartphone in market under 20000. All banking app are in security because when you just put any app in background then it will stop sharing data with sharing some important data only.Biometric security=> facelock can still be good because facelock having some trouble while recognizing face and finger print is fast but sometimes it don't recognize clearly but can be optimized by update and problem can be shot out.Charger=> charger is of 25w and charger adapter is durable for daily use, having type C to C wire cable is also good but it is short. Battery takes around 2hrs 3min to charge 0-100%. Reverse charging is not supporting in some device as pocco f1.System=> whatever 1UI is amazing UI, as I like OS of apple same I like 1UI.One of the biggest problems = NOT HAVING APPLOCK SYSTEM INBUILT WE HAVE TO USE THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS TO MAINTAIN OUR PRIVACY. Samsung should be aware that in this digital world every customer needs there privacy and you are not providing applock system, if no secure folder facilities no problem but applock is requirement of all mobile user.Overall mobile is value for money with quite overpriced. But one of the best smartphone with fulfilling all basic requirements of customers.

  The Galaxy M31s have a big screen, fast processor, long battery life, and most importantly, great front and back cameras. The Galaxy M31s is so good that it can easily take on many smartphones priced between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000. I spent the last month with the Galaxy M31s, and here is my take on the phone.Samsung Galaxy M31s specifications: 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display| Samsung Exynos 9611|6GB RAM/8GB RAM, 128GB storage, microSD support included|6000mAh battery, 25W fast charging support|32MP front camera, 64MP main camera+12MP ultra wide camera+5MP depth camera+5MP macro camera||Android 10, OneUI.The front of the phone has an edge-to-edge 6.5-inch AMOLED display and a small hole for the front-facing camera. Flip the phone, and you will notice the rectangular camera bump on the top left – the setup is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, a speaker, and a headphone jack.Despite its large 6.5-inch screen, I like how the phone feels in the hand. It’s light and easy to hold and use one hand. It’s a tall phone, though. The Galaxy M31s doesn’t look too flashy, but I am okay with that. But Samsung does cut some corners to keep the price down. Like the Galaxy A51, the M31s’s back panel is made of plastic with a glass-like finish, but you probably wouldn’t be able to differentiate. Still, the build quality is solid, though there is no waterproof rating. You can get the Galaxy M31s in Mirage Black and Mirage Blue colour options.The Galaxy M31s display is gorgeous. The 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen is perfect for watching movies, editing videos and reading epapers. The display is bright and colourful. That’s typical of a Samsung AMOLED display. Even though the Galaxy M31s display has a 60 Hz refresh rate, I bet there is no other phone in the mid-range and premium mid-premium segment with a better screen.Another welcome change is a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. Sure many phones (including popular mid-range devices) now include in-display fingerprint sensors, but they are not good. I liked how the side-mounted fingerprint sensor works. It’s way quicker and more reliable than in-display optical fingerprint sensors.Samsung has installed its Exynos 9611 chipset inside the Galaxy M31s (the same processor currently found in its Galaxy M31). Performance is on the higher side, surprisingly. I think 6GB RAM and 128GB storage come in handy when running games, taking pictures or shooting videos. Apps and websites open quickly; I did not register any lag or stutter while playing games like Sky, Temple Run and Lara Croft: Relic Run.I reviewed the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage model, but you can also opt for another variant – the one with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. If you think the 128GB storage is not enough (I think it’s enough for most people), the phone can take up to an additional 512GB of storage with a microSD card.And how does the battery last on the Galaxy M31s? Well, it lasted a generous day-and-a-half on a single charge on my review unit. The Galaxy M31s is powered by a 6,000mAh battery that can easily get you through two days. In my case, the battery died in the second half of the second day. I spent more time watching YouTube and streaming music through Apple Music. The 25W bundled fast charger will come handy.The phone ships with Android 10 along with Samsung’s One UI 2. It’s largely familiar but far from stock experience. It would be nice to see Samsung improving speedy software updates on its mid-range phones though.

   I'm writing this review after almost a week of daily usage. This is gonna be a kinda long one...Although the box does not include a earphone set. The box does come with a 25w super charger, the phone, manual and documentations, and a usb c to c cable.Samsung has done their best with the m31s. It has an awesome 6000MaH battery which really lasted almost 2 days with normal usage(feed checking and mediocre gaming).The processor is one of the best in class for this budget. Gaming is smooth with the 60hz display.I watched YouTube for almost 2 hours and the battery only went from 56 to 51. So don't even question the battery.You can also use your phone as a power bank as the phone itself can charge your peripheral devices such as bluetooth earbuds/earphones and your speakers. I use this reverse charging feature with an org to charge my bt headphone.The phone comes with sAmoled infinity-o display. The display is quite good and the picture quality is awesome. You can see any picture in direct sunlight.The only drawback for the phone was the charging time and the unoptimised camera app.Charging the phone from 10-80 will take you around 60-120mins. And from 80-100 will take you about 30-35 mins.These times didn't matter to me as the battery goes a long way round...and I mean it.The camera app is not optimised even though the camera itself is top notch. It just lacks enough features.Fingerprint reader is good. It sometimes doesn't capture the prints when it's slightly oily or dirty. Else all good.Samsung ai face recognition is inbuilt in the phone complete with ar mode.And lastly I would like to leave some tips on how to condition your phone so that it will last you a decade-First off, buy a screen protector and a back case with the phone.Do not charge your phone above 80%Even if you charge, don't do it daily. It reduces battery life.Give a break after every 1-2 hours.Don't charge your phone intermittently.Only charge your phone when the battery reduces beyond a certain point. (Say 40%)That's all. The phone is the best in class if u take care of it nicely! Well done Samsung.It's made in India. So I'm proud of me to own it.

  My experience with this phone is quite impressive and I didn't feel any disappointment during usage. But I could feel somehow for a better processor sometime which is not a big problem for a normal user.Ratings:1. Display 5*You will know the quality of the amoled  display when you use it. But remember 60hz display. Its ok for them who are not used to 90hz or 120hz2. Battery 5*One can use whole day for sure.3. Camera 5*Camera in this budget range is appreciatable4. Build 3*Could have improved. Its plastic back its ok type yet looks premium somehow but the overall package covers that thing5. Design 4*I like the design. Its good and also with both side USB type C6. Processor 3*Could have given a better or newer processor you won't find any difficulty  but may not be for the gamers of high end but it does the job and it's  perfect  for basic usage  without  any problem.Pros:1. Best 60hz display (Amoled display)2. Camera best in the budget3. Battery4. One UI is good as per my experience.5. Content consumption in this device will be good.Cons:1. Display could have 90hz2. Processor could have been better (OK for basic usage)3. Plastic build in back.Verdict:If you want to buy a smartphone under 25k and your main priority is camera, battery, and good display with 60hz then you are looking at the right device. Gaming is possibl here but I can see the multitasking  may feel a little slow when you do too many things but trust me it's  rare you will love the smoothie  of the device alog with one UI experience.And if this phone for basic usage mainly calling or content consumption. Simply go for it.My Rating: 8/10Reason: Processor and build qualityYes! It is made in IndiaI hope you find out some of your queries

  It is one the best phone you can get in this price rangeDisplay: you won't get best Display as samsung anywhere.  Because they are the masters of display technology.  SAMO LED experience is amazing.Camera: Front camera is very nice 32 MP which captures realistic photos. Its not like other brands which apply lots of filters and all. And beautification mode is also der so you can choose among the mode you need.Back camera is amazing,  its comes with Sony lense. Night fotos are really good and having good quality and detailed. Camera is bit saturated which  gives good images at day time. Even after zooming  image quality is not reducing much due to heavy detailed images captured by 64 MP camera. Microscopic camera also very  good capture good and detailed picture. Most interesting feature of camera is single take. It will automatically capture multiple fotos and videos with different settings and you can choose one from that on a single click.And camera assisting feature is there that help you to take good pictures . This will ask you to move camera in some orientation so that u can capture photos like a pro.camera setup in this phone is better than one plus nord.Sound: loude and clear sound, nd Dolby atom you can experience.Battery life : you will be getting  2 to 3 days for normal usage. Charging  takes around 1.30 hours.Performance: I m not a gamer, bt for normal operation its very smooth. I didn't find any lag anywhere.Finger print sensor : its very quick and easily  accessible.Verdict:Phone weight is 208 grms(most phone with good battery comes in this range).Overall good phone suggesting to everyone who is not a great fan of games.

  I purchased it on prime day sale on 6th midnight. Kind of need in hurry as I lost my previous redmi note 8 pro. Got it on 12th August. I would try to justify my money.1. Display with little tiny punch hole in between is called me infinity O display and its really awesome.2. 6000mAh battery is gigantic and serves pretty well though I am not a avid gamer but I have pretty much on screen time for different Web series.3. I have tested it on Amazon Prime Videoand it gives you 1080p video quality but strange thing is that when I played 4k video from YouTube it also only gave me 1080 output.4. Front camera is also good and it serves the purpose well with features like if you raise your hand it will take selfie automatically.5. One confusing thing is that when you power on this phone it says it is secured by Knox (Samsung provided security and a best one like we find in apple) and also it shows it has Knox version 3.5 but when I try to d secure folder which is obviously a Knox supported thing, Google play store depicted that my device is not supported for it. Also when I checked Samsung website for Knox supported device m31s was not there.6. Coming to storage, system chews up around 17.8GB out 128GB.7. I have purchased the phone with 8GB RAM and RAM uses is pretty decent doesn't chew that much on normal use.8. Now talking about processor Exyons 9611 really disappointed. Processor really lags even I was searching amazon app through couple of other things. I could tell you the difference as I have just lost my redmi note 8 Pro.9. Rare camera is OK. Don't know if Sony imx 682 sensor is going to make any difference. To be frank I have to experiment more with camera for giving more honest and deeper review on this.Last but not least build quality is good. Color mirage blue looks eye catching. Finger print reader and your lock button are the same so you will have bit trouble with registering your finger on that strip and mastering the unlock but once you are habituated it would not be a problem. Face unlock feature works really well and fast.That's all for now. I will update the review as I go on.

  Pathetic and hell disappointed from samsung received it on 21 August  and started using it notice lag and hang but ignored and on 13th September received the  update and after updating.There is no network on my both sim and tried every options available and finally had to take it to service center and can you imagine what it feels like to invest in a new phone and within a month it stop working. Then service center asked me to wait for 10 days and after 10 days service center called me up to tell they won't b able to repair and they have raise the request for the coupon but instead of coupon I asked samsung to return my money bt samsung was adamant abt coupon and finally have to agree with their terms .And guys this coupon comes with condition that you have to redeem this coupon from samsung brand store only this it's too pathetic means u can't even redeem the coupon on their website u have to go for offline shopping . And considering the fact M series is for  online then and now wether it's available offline now am not sure hence being only online series Samsung literally forced me to pay extra for the new phone and unwillingly I did by paying extra 3500 for A51.I deeply regret why I choose to buy samsung product if they would have returned my money I would have never ever bought the Samsung product again in my life...So fellas this is my experience with samsung wish none of you have to go through this but trust me they hardly care abt after sales services where as other brands are prompt enough to their customer queries and problems so be vigilant while choosing samsung bcoz they simply claims big bt deliver not even 1 percent of it.

  Currently, I am using Galaxy M31s for almost a month, purchased it as soon as the sale started on Amazon. Got the phone after waiting a few days, started using it, and found few issues.Weak ProcessorSamsung has used its own Exynos 9611 chipset in Galaxy M31s. prior to this. Many other Samsung phones have used this chip, like Galaxy M31s, M31, M21, A51, etc. The performance of Galaxy M31s is not adequate, because of the Exynos 9611.Exynos 9611 has an octa-core CPU (4x 2.3GHz Cortex-A73 cores + 4x 1.7GHz Cortex-A53) and Mali G72 MP3 GPU. If you are a light user or using it for some casual work, you won’t notice much. overall mediocre performance you will get of Galaxy M31s.Exynos 9611Exynos 9611In day to day use, you will see lag, stuttering while opening the app. Some apps will take a longer time to open, especially games. For casual gaming, it can handle most of the part by lowering settings, not recommended for heavy gamers. Exynos 9611 in this price segment is not justified.Now, heavy and moderate users will not like the performance after some use. The thing is after you put some load and start multitasking it will show its true face. Even cheaper phone tends to perform well where Galaxy M31s struggles.OverpricedSamsung Galaxy M31s is priced at ₹19,499 for 6GB RAM/128GB Storage and ₹21,499 for 8GB RAM/128GB Storage. It should be around ₹2000 less from the existing price point, just because of Exynos 9611.If Samsung reduces the price of Galaxy M31s, they have to reduce the whole M-series price – Not possible.Now, Samsung launched the Galaxy M51 at ₹22,999 (6+128 GB) and ₹24,999 (8+128 GB). At least Samsung has chosen to go with Snapdragon 730G SoC. The major highlighting feature of M51 is the big monstrous 7000 mAh battery, fascinating battery life will get.Other featuresSatisfied with most of the features, built quality, UI, etc. One UI on top of Android 10 is good in this smartphone. RAM management is great, even if lots of apps are open, it handles it very well ( Used 6GB version). There are few bloatware comes pre-installed but you can uninstall it, that a great part.Battery backup is excellent in this phone, comes with 6000 mAh capacity. This capacity battery is enough for last you more than a day or two. Samsung has included a 25W fast charger in the box, charging is not an issue now (reverse charging supported).It comes with a 6.5-inch AMOLED 60Hz display, corning gorilla glass 3 protection, Widevine L1 support. Because of AMOLED, the screen is crisp and clear, good quality display we get.The camera performance is overall good. Samsung has improved the camera on this phone to make it better from Galaxy M31.Final VerdictExynos 9611 is limiting the performance of Galaxy M31s. Because every other feature and hardware is good or descent, considering its a Samsung phone. Samsung should either design new Exynos SoC or use Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset for their smartphone.If you are a sort of heavy user, don’t buy it, you will get irritated after some time. But if you are like, who wants only a Samsung phone, this smartphone is best to buy. Other options, like Galaxy M51 with SD730G, is also available now, or think of cheaper variant Galaxy M31 or M21 to save some money.

  It's the best phone for gorgeous screen and battery. It last's long that's what she said. Lmao.After 1 day use this is my opinion:-At this price Samsung should have atleast offered a Tpu case.-Exysnos doesn't have much horsepower Snapdragon would have been better.-Under good lighting condition Camera performs well and portrays good colour.-Punch hole display on this phone gets you a feeling you are using a Note 10 lite.

Marco & wide angle is also have better quality & good detailing one.Battery life- Battery is is also good, I'm rough user but than also min 12 hour of  continue usage.Display- As we all know with Samsung's Display we got Amazing View Experience.Lagging Problem- Till yet I can't face amy issue regarding this.Heating problem- Little bit I face this problem, but if you  use in Directly sunlight for hours.Gaming Experience- In this I do not faced any problems in normal setting.Dual window Support is not available in this, one of biggest disappointing point. You can't use Dual window/ more than one application on display.Optimization is working perfectly.Entirely my experience is Amazing with this phone.Value of money.

  Really it's an amazing mobile within the price range.Features at its best are:-1. Battery(6000mah). Solid battery life for the current usage with apps and games2. Camera quality. 64MP primary camera with three other cameras support was awesome and the picture quality was better to the best3. RAM(128gb). It has a solid memory which enables and encourages you to have your favourite and needy apps within your mobile.4. HD display screen. Will make you to feel like superb when you are watching videos and movies within OTT.I felt somewhat lag in the finger print sensor while reading the login and side finger print sensor is sometimes creating issues as when we are carrying with hand, it is trying to read and failing to do so.My overall rating is 4/5 with all the features included.

  I got the  06gb 128gb at the price of 18000. Totally honest review display is up to the mark beating the Chinese one even in 30 k range. Camera is superb specially rear cam which got new sony 682 sensor. Battery on average will be sufficient for full two days with heavy usage n if you are a moderate user then it will last for three days.charging is average n it will take around 70 minutes from 5% to 100.peformance is average it's not for heavy gaming so PUBG at ultra settings will lag a little bit. But if you are a patriot then buying a non Chinese phone will make a little but important difference. Go for it n encourage people around you to buy non Chinese products even if you have to pay a little bit more for that. Jai Hind.

  Pros :1. Display -- Amazing Super Amoled2. Battery -- Huge 6000mAh3. Camera -- Great especially the Single Take feature4. Reverse Charging -- Excellent, you can use this phone as a power bank as the cable in box is type c to type c5. Charger -- 25W fast charging6. UI -- Very good and easy to operate7. Fingerprint scanner on side is very Fast8. Gradient look is nice...Cons :1. Chipset still Exynos 9611 (10nm). This could have been better at this price range....2. Charging cable pin is not fit for other power banks. It's very disappointed.3.The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??Over all ...Great product....👍4.5 on 5

  I am using Samung M31s from last 20+ days now, following are my key observationsPricing :- i bought it at Rs 21499, which is very decent for a brand like Samung and features that come along.Camera :- I loved the most, only i found the zoom is bit annoying, it should be improved.Battery :- I rarely worry about charging, 6000 mah suits my requirements with phone in hand most of the time, not found any heating issues even after watching movie for continuous 3 hrs.Fingerprint :- Fingerprint works well, but you put on the back cover you need to struggle a bit to use fingerprint for quick access.Display quality :- As always Samung is known for its S Amoled screen, which i actually find attractive than any other phones , real colours will amaze you more than other Chinese brands.Sound :- Very decent, you don't need any additional support with earphones or speaker when you are watching something on your M31s , so you can keep it handsfree.

  I had received this mobile on 31st August and I am  writing this review after 15 days.I have noticed the following during these 15 days:1.the fingerprint reader is very accurate.2.the 64mp rear camera with Sony imx 682 sensor with 10x zoom is excellent when it compared with the other mobiles in samsung M & A Series.3. Each and every thing is clearly identical from  32mp front camera. Moreover it comes as an  in display Punctual camera.4.the display is amazing with super amoled infinity  o display.5.the 6000mah battery can be used for two days  and It can be charged rapidly with the 25w  charger.6.the reverse charging feature is very useful like a  power bank.7. Exynos 9611 processor is also good and working  very smoothly for gaming and general use.*Finally I want to say that the samsung is a non chinese Company when compared to others.

Phone is heating like heater..from back side and while talking only 2 min phone got so hot, I wasn't able to keep next to ear. I bought this phone from Amazon. Now m getting reply from samsung customer care tht this phone is not returnable because all these points mentioned on samsung site. But nothing mentioned at amazon while purchasing I checked. I just have one phone with such things last 2days m not able to work. All the time on call downloading said apps n waiting for customer care to do something. And at the end thy said they will send technician home to chek my phone after 4 days...till then m helpless. Never happened wid any purchase through amazon. Amazon always help. But this time thy r also not replying.

  I booked the phone within minutes of its launch, wish I had not. The camera crashed in the first few days and then the speakers. There was no spare part available which is understandable due to th pandemic. However , Samsung taking two weeks to issue a voucher is totally unacceptable. Why no instant refund? Why are we forced to buy another product from Samsung when their products are not meeting our expectations and basic requirement.My M20S is also not doing that great in terms of speakers which spoilt in the first few months itself.

  Even after this Amazon's Great Indian Festival sale I find this phone a bit pricey. But still the performance of the phone makes it worth it.Here are some pros and cons mentioned about Samsung M31s :-Pros:-1. It has got a processor of Exynos 9611 which gives you flawless performance. Playing heavy games does not show any lag or also no heating issues are seen.2. Its has got 6GB of ram which helps me during multi-tasking.3. The screen has vibrant colors, watching movies on this device was fun.4. Camera quality is awesome, it works best during bright shoots. I did record 4k videos on this device which actually made feel the quality of the video.5. Its Bezel less display even enlarges the viewing area.Cons:-1. It shows that it has Knox security but it misses some of its main functions like Secure Folder.2. During night that camera works average.3. The build quality is fine, not too good.

  Iam a Samsung mobile user since 2014. My first Samsung mobile is Galaxy S5, I'm impressed with the features of Galaxy S5, and my second mobile is Galaxy S7, Many of my friends said, don't buy S7 it's getting over heat, worst processor and worst battery. But I bought S7, I'm impressed again with the display quality, Camera quality and many other features of the phone and I became a big fan of Samsung mobiles. After 3 years 4 months usage of my S7, I am going to upgrade my mobile from S7 to M31s. The M31s mobile is a budget flagship mobile. It has a maximum battery with 36 hrs battery backup and a maximum display quality with ultra HD experience. Great 64MP camera with intelligent camera and single take feature is awesome. Thank you Samsung to giving 25 watts super fast charger. The oneUI is good to using with single hand. Finally the mobile phone is a good mobile for minimal mobile users.

  The product is a clear example of how great Samsung mobiles are. You may compare them to other Chinese brands that would probably coat less but can never give you the quality and feel of owning a genuine peice of art designed to cater to all the needs of a user. The camera with the Sony lens is class apart from anything offered by any brand in the segment specially the addition of a good quality macro camera in addition to the 64MP main camera. For selfie enthusiasts, it offers number of features that make the experience feel very premium. The battery backup of 6000mah is sufficient to last over 1.5 days for any user. The sAMOLED display makes the entire experience of using the phone truly amazing. Additional features like Atmos Dolby sound for audio devices, samsung knox security, AR features, Bixby vision are some of the features that add to the experience. All in all its a great purchase at this cost and gives great performance.

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it.

   #UNBIASED CUSTOMER REVIEWI was looking to buy a new phone since 4-5 months under 20000. Writing the review after using it for 40-Days(i Will write points which are not covered in those YouTube unboxing Videos)1. My initial requirement was an Amoled display(trust me it does make a lot of difference and is a lot better then those IPS displays. Additionally people in paid review also say that its will work fine but why to compromise?? you are paying for it)2. I wanted a Sony sensor which is a lot better than other 64MP/48MP sensor brands(for comparison please refer to YouTube videos)3. My third requirement was a rectangle/horizontal camera design and Neutral colors for phone's body.  Few Chinese origin companies are manufacturing PINK body( Phone should look classy. I think they should invest more in R&D and customer choices. Pink phone seriously?)4. A Decent processor since as i am not really a hard core gamer.5. A non- Chinese preferred-India manufactured preferred.FINAL VERDICT AFTER USING IT FOR 40 DAYSI . I Have literally checked out every single phone in the price range and nothing looked better than M31s.It Gives me 24 hours of backup even after using it for whole day.( Mild gaming, heavy Youtube, Google meet/zoom sessions)II. Camera is awesome specially primary sensor and Macro sensor + vlogging mode while video recording. crystal clear images as well as videos. Also it doesn't take makes your photos look OVER SATURATED AND CARTOONY which happen with all the Chinese brands. See the image of Tulsi leaf i have clicked from its 64 MP Sony IMX 682 primary sensor, The second image is just a cropped form of the same 1st image and you can see the thorns on the edge of the Tulsi leaf.III. Build quality is awesome feels premium, people notice it. Call quality is crisp and clearIV. AT LAST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW - THE PROCESSOR: Since last 40 days i am using M31s and my usage is - Mild Pubg, cod and clash of clan and Asphalt + Handling heavy office documents + multi tasking + playing 4K videos and so on. And till now it hasn't hanged, not even a single time, works smooth like a butter Thanks to Samsung's Software Optimization and R&D wing. Of course if you are a heavy gamer who invests  6+  hours in gaming and requires highest quality gaming experience then this phone is not for you i will suggest you to invest more and go for Gaming phones(35k+).V. KNOX SECURITY IS INCLUDEDCons-1. No screen recording (fix it by downloading 3rd party app)2. I couldn't get Mirage black color due to it's unavailability during the launch day.I was looking for a phone since Feb 2020 and have literally tried every phone but none was Perfect for the price range available. They offer a lot of things on paper but in reality its a hoax. Just go for M31s if you have the same requirements as mentioned above you won't regret it.#UNBIASED CUSTOMER REVIEW

And guess what all these thing happened just after the launch of this Monstor.Not only i'm doing all my official work on this phone. I also Bingwatch all my favorite shows & movies on M31s big crystal clear screen.also being a video creator I make all my videos with this phone, means camera was one of the main reason I bought this phone, and in this section it has defeated all his competiters.Even all my video editing happen on this phone only, without any hustle, so no more laptop heat on my lap.Only problem I have with this is phone is, I wish it had come with any headphone, so I didn't have to bought them from the market.

  I have categorised this mobile in 5 following parts1. Rear camera- rear camera of mobile is too good and takes good images.2. Front camera-front camera of mobile takes decent images but some times struggle even 10,000 mobiles can compete and defeat it.3. Processor-using  this phone can,t see any lag in processor even before pubg was banned I played pubg daily for 1.5 hours but no hang issue was there so processor should not be concerned4.battery- battery is not like 6000mah it fells like 4200 mAh because it discharge quickly but this mobile battery charged 0 to 100 °/. In 1hour45 minutes.so this is not concern from practical point.5.display-one of best display. If you use it you will feel it. Plus point-if your priority is back camera ,display,battery then buy this phone .processor is also not that bad. And plus point is it's design.but if your priority is front camera don,t go for this mobile.But this is good then all Chinese craps selling around 20 k to 25k

  Excellent mobile both in terms of usage and specifications. I am not a heavy gamer but yes I play few games. Processor do not lag at all for me. Battery life is super awesome, I am heavy internet user surfing Facebook, whatsapp, telegram, messenger, YouTube, watching almost all webseries over all platforms and battery supports whole day for me. Super amoled display is supercool. I am enjoying watching webseries and movies it. The most I love is night mode of this camera. Night photos are just excellent. I got the phone at Prime day sale in 18000 rupees. This mobile has added everything extra which can really makes all its user happy. If you are not a heavy gamer then just go for it. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery and thanks Samsung for this smartphone. Your R&D works perfect and develop such value for money phone for us.

    Overall Good Smartphone under 20k.

  Samsung m31s is a good choice for those who are looking for non Chinese  smartphone  under 20k. The best thing about this smartphone is its battery life, single take camera feature and its super Amoled infinity o display. As a student I recommend  all those prospective  buyers who are studying to buy this one. It is safe and secure as compared to other smartphone  under 20k. Its display is so immersive and beautiful  that one cannot  deny it buying. Although it comes with exynos  9611 but trust me guys it's so optimized that you can do your most of the work without  any problem.  Yeah  this is  not  made for those high end game users. There is no haptic feedback in this phone. Camera quality I will say is good it shows you good colors  in pic which most people like to share it on social  media platforms.

  Nothing much to complain about it but please note if you're investing in this device, also invest in a matte tempered glass to avoid fingerprints.Its a fingerprint magnet.Cameras are ok for this price,it would be better if they provided a Qualcomm processor like 720 or 730G.Battery life is excellent.Display is great for media consumption.And a bonus ""headphone jack""I was still expecting a silicon case inside box if not earphones.

  My review is based on my 1 week of use.Fingerprint reader: Too small, but easily accessible. Out of initial 10 chances, it got my fingerprint correct 9 times. I felt difficulty while registering my fingerprint due to its small size.Battery life: I don't do gaming, but do watch videos and other online surfing. Based on my regular use, for single full charge, I can use comfortably for 2 days.Camera Quality: Default camera Quality is less, so have to change to get that 64MP feature. And the 64MP camera is really good. I still don't know how that intellisense works.Other features: Most of the features of Samsung like glance are really nice and never faced any hanging issues for now. Face recognition- out of 5 attempts, it got recognised 3 times.Conclusion: I'm very happy with the product as initially I had doubts since this my first Samsung Galaxy (previously I used Redmi). I would really recommend this product for this cost range. Thank you

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Battery life is awesome. Last more than 1.5days for normal-heavy use.Rear camera quality is great, good for macro shots, ultrawide is also great for group photos.Front camera quality is good but not great, its also a wide angle camera.Performance is really poor, phone started lagging within 2 months of usage. Never buy Samsung if u want smooth experience.Fingerprint reader works 70% of the time but not always.Display is fantastic, no phone in this range compete with this display.Overall the phone is great.Sample shots attached.

  Got it delivered on Aug 17 and its been 10 days of my usage. My views arePros1, First should be its vibrant super Amoled display. Gives us a rich display to embrace for.2, Camera quality - front and rear is superior which is enhanced by Sony sensor3, Great battery capacity - 6000 mah ( great fit for high end user)4, Exynos processor seems to be working fine without any major lag.5, No heating issue faced so far. Even while playing with high end games.6, 25 watts quick charger ramping up the battery percentage flawlessly.Cons1, Major drawback is with fingerprint sensor. It is side mounted with powerbutton which makes it not userfriendly as it gets malfunctioned frequently due to the dirt formation. Its large size too aggravating the problem by our mobile holding pattern.2, Though the battery capacity is huge, its seems to be draining fast with continuous wifi usage.3, Should have included type C USB cable along with other accessories.

  It is an awesome phone with best in class screen and battery. It stand out with bright punchy colours and a full flat display which gives you a feel of premium device. A small center hole punch selfie camera makes it more beautiful. A dual coloured back with gradient shift gives more premium and classy feel. Camera bump is square with a proper combination of good quality cameras. Photos seems decent with perfect post processing gives you natural photos. Single shot feature is a cherry on the cake. As per my usage which mostly includes WhatsApp, documentation, using camera for video conferencing and watching Netflix streams gives me almost one and half day. UI design and functionality is awesome and clean without any adds

    Average and overpriced
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Average phone. Display and battery good but even though the battery is 6000 mAh , the backup is more or same like the ones with 4500 mAh or 5000 mAh because they have more efficient chipsets.  The most disappointing of the features is that 4G advanced or LTE+ is not enabled even though the exynos 9611 supports it.  Even 3 year phones have that. As a result the 4G speed actually suffers. With my one month usage it has received 2 updates yet no optimization or bug fixes or as I said LTE+ update , they are only providing security updates for now.But if anyone is just buying it for the battery and camera please don't its more or less the same as other competitors with much less performance and huge lags while multitasking.

  Based on two day usage of the phone,so far it seems to be quite  a dependable and reliable smartphone.The design and build quality  is quite  premium just like samsungs flagship  devices,considering  it's  polycarbonate...still the body seems to be made of high quality plastics.rear camera is superb and I won't  hesitate to say that it's  d best camera phone under 20k.selfie camera is also really  good.samsungs One UI works really  well and is easy to use.the best part about  this phone is it's  display which is just stunning...samsung just has d clear edge in terms of displays...it's  perfect  for viewing  HD content on Netflix and YouTube.The battery life is good though i think it needs more optimization....but it can  last one and half day after heavy usage.performance is also amazing although this phone is not for heavy gaming and that's  quite clear....all in all..it's a really good phone in it's  price segment  and I wud definitely  recommend  it to anyone  looking  for a good phone under 20k.

    Defective product with poor warranty support from Samsung
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  We purchased Samsung M31S just two months back. It is still new without even a single indicating that it has no external damage. Handset stopped working and unable to boot. It just shows boot screen with Samsung logo and doesn't move forward.Samsung turned out to be pathetic company. In city like Hyderabad, I have to travel 35kms for Authorised service station for warranty and service. Timings are till 8PM but they are running centres like charitable trust with customers looking like beggars. They issue token and only 40 and you have to wait hours. I was turned down even to issue token at 6PM. Then I went to another center on another corner of city. They refused to check considering it's late at 7PM though they are open till 8PM but busy in chatting around. Pathetic service. I visited three times in last two days and learned from other similar customers that the center will finally refuse warranty after making us run around for weeks. Do not purchase this pathetic Samsung product.

  I like this phone other than battery life and network quality. I realized the battery performance is average and network catching power is very poor. Whereas, I am getting good signal in my old phone. I am getting good signal in mt old phone and can talk in side of my house but to make a call from Galaxy M31s phone I have to go outside to catch the good signal to talk. Also, camera needs to be improve.Expecting bug fixing to improve the networking issue and camera picture quality.

    Amazing phone
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  So I got the phone almost a month ago. The phone is amazing. Even despite having the usual exynos processor the phone runs smooth with 8gb of ram. The sound quality is perfect.  It's loud and clear. The battery lasts almost a day and half with continuous usage and also gets charged within an hour.The best part about the phone is its camera. The camera has a 3:4 normal resolution mode and a 3:4 64mp resolution mode for the back camera. This mode takes really good quality pictures and I just love them. The macro camera also does not disappoint, so does the depth or portrait camera mode. If you like taking good quality pictures and don't want to spend big bucks, this is the phone you should go for.Edit: The phone starts to heat up when the slo mo or super slow mo feature is used.Also the back side of the phone picks up smudges from the hand easily. I use a transparent cover to solve this problem because I like the mirage effect of the phone.Sometimes the apps get frozen when the phone gets locked and then unlocked. I need to go back to home screen in order to unfreeze the apps. But maybe this is a bug and will be removed in the next software update.

  Looking at the ad I was so excited to buy this phone with all its mentioned feature camera and storage but the sad reality sunk in when I finally got this phone and check it out. The camera quality (front) is so bad ,I say bad because for a 64p camera and the quality image it gives its not what I expected.I used to use samsung S5 the front camera was only 16megapixel but the image quality was awesome. Samsung M31s camera is no match to 16megapixel of Samsung S5. And the storage almost ,made me cry of regret, M31s is 8gb but 4 go is already used by the system and only 4gb is free for usage. Storage is 128gb but 20gb is already used up byour the system. This week opportunity F17 was released not initially I considered busing it but then I changedon't my mind not bought this because I don't want to use Chinese product. But I deeply now buying this. In another word if you want to buy good stuff go for expensive ones don't fall for ad that shows good feature at a cheap price ,you will regret.

  Not a value for money.0) after a month I realised that phone is working fine but it is not supporting different type of app during accessing any app or web browser, app is stucking but if we scroll screen from to bottom phone is showing settings screen. So my thought is that this processor is not good to operate different apps.1) additional features  are not provided2) camera  not looking  too good3) battery not as good as claimed  by  Samsung4) we got only RAM 8 GB ( in new phone used 5 GB almost why ?)& main storage  128 GB ( in new phone occupied 23- 25 gb why?.6) heavy  body so side fingerprint  sensor  not handling  easily because  we need hold this phone from back side also carefully  and that time our index finger keep in back side of this phone so sensor  should  be there and also Samsung  not providing phone receiving  facility  from fingerprint  sensor.7) I have Tecno 8000/- Rs. Which is very lightweight , good fingerprint  sensor back side and call receiving  functionality also.8) I observed  it is hanging  also sometimes.

  Before buying smartphone I have gone through all the brands and reviews then finally selected Samsung galaxy M31s and Samsung never failed to satisfying me. Yeah..! my option is always right.It is good product under budget. Got it for 18.5k in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight when compared to redmi and other brands though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support. Feeling awesome while watching movies and playing games with 6.5"" screen display.Super fast charger. Just 30 mins charging can help you to use it more than a day. That's the best thing in it.4 cameras and 1 selfie camera we can get in Samsung galaxy M31s and the picture quality is also awesome.Side finger print sensor is very good. Stylish gradient design. I bought mirage blue it's looking so stylish.Overall when compared to other smartphones I honestly say Samsung galaxy M31s is the best one with this budget. I suggested all my friends and relatives too to buy Samsung galaxy M31s after seen this they also bought and feel Happy.If u people looking for a great smartphone under low budget you can go for Samsung without any hesitations. This is the best ever smartphone I have used before. Happily giving 5 out of 5 starts to my Samsung galaxy M31s.☆☆☆☆☆:)

  Fingerprint: Maybe slower for me. Because if we use back case for this phone then fingerprint is partially cover so that's why slow for me otherwise it's working well.Battery: it's battery life is like a spider life. Like spider live 12 years without any food or water. Same likewise this battery living a very long time.Camera: front and rare both camera are awesome working. And I like mostly single take feature of this. But for zoom I saw the pic is not clear when I clicked.Others:1. The design of the phone is best of the ultimate version, It's punch hole front camera make it unique from others phone.2. Now if we talk about gaming So yes it is the best for all the games work smoothly and 6GB RAM makes it's funxtionality more smoother.3. its storage make its price range smoother.So basically it is one of the best phone for middle range people.

  I bought  this Device  basically for Camera, but Samsung  M31s made me disappointed. Writing  this review after 2 month of use, everything  is just touching  the standard level. Battery is not that beast  as it has been described  before launching. I am comparing with  Redmi Note 7 regarding  camera and Battery. Really disappointed. Specifically  the night Camera and video recording  has so much noise, a 12-15 k other phones are performing  better. never recommended, waste of money if you are looking for a camera phone which do video recording as well.

  HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series isPROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.

  I was using Huawei before i purchased this phone.1. Camera - i would say Huawei was better. After taking a picture even with the help of Tripod, Huawei gave a more stable picture and when I zoom in the image, words in Huawei was more clearer than Samsung. That does not mean this camera is worst. Images are at fine quality from a phone perspective, dont imagine this as an DSLR replacement or something Close to it like ""Our reporter shot this video on Samsung M31S""2. Battery is good. Charges at short time and gets down after long usage of the device3. Finger print sensor - definitely needs loads of improvement. It detects but the button appears to be curved inwards, so most part of the thumb does not get detected which leaves me to only option, enter pin. Well thats easy!!! Using thumb finger isnt a best idea so better use fore or middle finger. With corona around, dont use your tongue or toe finger or never try it with Gloves.4. Best part is the display. It is sooooo good and at this prices, you put it in the right track.5. Speakers are good comparing to Huawei.Few suggestions though,OEM tempered glass and transparent case as gift would be great. Unable to use the phone on the same day. Had to go to shop to get the protection before using it.An additional box packing might be essential. Both M31s and M51 that i ordered came with a damaged box. Phone was safe but might  not be the case always.Also, wanted to say REST IN PEACE for Samsung CEO. You really changed lives with Samsung products.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.

  Design: 5 starsThe back panel gives the phone a really rich look. The ergonomics are pretty good too, it's easy to hold and operate in one hand. And the almost invisible bezels with punch hole camera is truly amazing.Display: 5 starsSamsung phones are famous for their rich displays ofcourse and this phone is no exception.Biometrics: 4 starsFingerprint sensor placement is so convenient since it is on the unlock button. The response is commendable. The reason for 4 stars would be the facial recognition feature, I found it a bit slow in terms of response time.Sound: 5 starsAudio quality on earphones us top notch when Dolby is enabled, it's a rich audio experience indeed. The speakers are great too.Camera: 5 starsWell, I am no champ at camera tech, but for an average user, the picture quality is great. Thanks to the advances in software and both hardware, on comparison with my Galaxy Note 8, I found M31s pictures much better.Battery life: 5 starThis battery will easily last you 2 days on full charge with moderate use. It's a powerhouse indeed. The charging speed is uber awesome.User Interface/ Software:One word - Smooth. Did not notice any lags. Samsunf has brought lot of improvements for ease of use. No disappointments in this area as well.It's a lovely phone at this price tag and definitely a worth buy. Samsung phones are known to be durable, its worth investing a few thousands more and buy a quality phone. With every launch, Samsung is becoming more and more competitive in the mobile markets.Thank you for reading, hope you find it useful!

The finger print scanner is at a very convenient position.2.Display qualityThe beauty of this display comes out in HD videos,i've played aftermovies of UMF on it and it is just pure awesomeness. The colors appear to be pleasing to the eyes.3.Battery lifeIt is truely a MONSTER. Easily gives 10 hrs of on screen time. And it easily lasts 1.5 days for a heavy user.4.Camera setupSo far the best camera setup for this price. Night mode doesn't make the photos look like they're taken in nightmode at all. It feels like a full light setup when you click it. Night mode performance is awesome. I've taken an hour long videos and timelapse videos,slo mo videos and the performance of the camera unit is stunning. A little tweak here and there will give you photos and videos to cherish forever.5.PerformanceThe processor is fast enough for day to day tasks. I've done video editing in it for some videos and the performance is good enough to sail you through. Sometimes,the phone gets heated while using camera for an hour or more constant usage.So a REALLY good buy in this range. The best non chinese smartphone for this price range. Totally satisfied with this purchase.

  First of all i haven't written any review in my life writing for the first time, basically I'm a huge Fan of Samsung But Samsung disappointed me in 3 aspects in this M31s1.Battery - FYI it doesn't work like a 6000 Mah. It just works like a 4000 Mah and my device charged for a good 2 hr 30 mins for 100%Seriously are you kidding Samsung. Who waits for charging upto 2 hrs and 25w charger doesn't do any good work. It's just another charger and the optimisation in the Samsung shockingly not good in this device whereas in my previous M31 and S8+, they are efficienctly good2.Camera - Although Camera Output is GoodThe problem lies with the shutter speed. If you have to take a pic then you have to uphold the pose for good 3-4 sec 🙄 Disaster to say the least. Yes Outputs are great but why this lag. And if you are using flash then good luck. The flash needs another 1 more second tym to operate and previews too take time to load.. Don't know why all this happening in a mobile with 6GB RAM3 Processor - even though I'm not a heavy gamer, I play pubg at tyms but the game play was very very bad and screen fluctuating at lowest settings. I know about this processor but it has to perform at least once in a while for gaming but it doesn't perform.Display too not the Regular AMOLED you see in High end devices.. just for name sake it's a AMOLED deviceI Bought this mobile and sold it within 15 days with loss of 3k. Only recommend for the people who just use for calls, WhatsApp and Instagram but why would you spend 20k If you only use them 🤷🏻‍♂️

  First thing first, the m31s stand the best phone under 20,000 why I'm saying thisThe reasons-1. It has 6000 mAh battery life which also supports reverse charging.2. I fall love in with the display of m31s and its punch hole looks very nice.3. The camera is awesome 64mp nd 32 mp, I also shared some pics which was taken from m31s.4. It comes with 6 GB ram and 128 storage within the 20,000.5. Finally, it has the tag of SAMSUNG which really matters.But with all this also found some minor dissatisfaction which are-1. I found that headphone jack is not working properly although it delivers the best music experience with Dolby Atmos after a few minutes I can hear of buzz sound I dont know why.2. The processor could be Lil bit better.Overall I found this phone value for money 🙂 thank u Samsung for the first time I appreciate your works under this price.

  For the first time am using a samsung. For yrs I was using various asus smartphones. But currently no updated budget phones are available for asus so I switched to samsung and it was the only option. 8 gb 128 variantReview after seven days. A good device at this price point. Not for heavy gamers. But excellent for a medium gamers and top for normal users. Real racing 3 work perfectly without any frame miss or lagWell engineered device. Balanced hardware combination with suitable chipset for allrounder performance. With no doubt u can purchase if u a looking for a best class mobile at this time.A excellent display as usual seen in samsung.Side mounted fingerprint reader is non conventional but it will be handy to use within few days. Very efficient since the reader size is less than the quarter of normal rear mount reader and perfectly works. No lag6000mah battery is not a wonder for me bcuz i was using 5000 mah asus max for last 4 yrs. But the fastcharger is mindblowing. Using for last 7 days. Never fully charged till now. Excellent battery life. 59% of battery charge is enough for 2 days of normal use. I mean that much excellent the battery. Each and every percent of charge is used efficiently and optimized manner. No heavy battery drain or heating on play games like Real racing 3.Rear cam is awesome. But frnt cam is poor. Over beautification is there in the front cam. And no option to change or vary that. For frnt cam 32 mp is just a number i think. Even realme's 8mp frnt is more clear.Overall a good phone with durable hardware so that i hope it can last for atleast 3 yrs when compared to those chinese phone.And also hope there will be no performance deterioration with time as the Samsung is one of the trusted brand.Dark mode is a better option but lacks the split screen option so for the entire 6.5 inch screen we are supposed to use a single app at a time.Personally, lack of led indication affect me lot bcuz don't know if there is any msgs arrived until i take the device in hand. Led indication is not available for almost all recent devices. Like 'always on display' feature, a in-display indication can be provided if samsung cares the users.Light sensor is very very excellent. Adaptive brightness works efficiently.Biometric updating is great. For every 72 hrs if we are not using pin or pattern unlock system demand to use it so that no chance to forget the pattern. That's good. Double tap lock is not available but double tap on is there...Able to add only 3 fingerprints thats a limitation. No inbuilt power management app for costumized power plan even 4yrs back devices provides those features. Network switch is great. In screen lock is available during gaming...in built game booster so on...Overall a just good wow phone.. not for a wooow... worth for the money. Greater fone in low budget range.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s marks a small upgrade in the design language that Samsung has employed in its M-series lineup so far. While the basic plastic look and feel of the device remain largely the same as its predecessors, the Galaxy M31s opts for a gradient coloring on the back which gives the device its own identity. The Mirage Black unit that we received starts off with a silver-chrome color towards the top and merges into a black color towards the bottom. The chrome color is a little difficult to capture on camera, and the gradient is a lot more gradual in the middle than what the device renders suggest. The back also has a glossy finish.The mid-frame, back panel, and buttons on the device are all polycarbonate. It’s clear that Samsung uses polycarbonate to bring down the cost of the device, and we are largely content with the decision as long as the savings are passed onto consumers. Plus, polycarbonate phones weigh less, meaning that you don’t really notice the massive 6,000mAh battery weighing your wrists down.The front of the Samsung Galaxy M31s is also occupied by the 6.5″ FHD+ Super AMOLED display, which is very good. The only disappointment that I had was the lack of a higher refresh rate—we can spot several phones with 90Hz and even 120Hz refresh rate in this price segment in India, so Samsung seriously needs to consider an upgrade in this department. As far as viewability and other display qualities are concerned, I am quite content with what the Samsung Galaxy M31s has to offer. Samsung’s AMOLEDs are some of the best in the market, and the Galaxy M31s is in the same boat.The bottom of the Galaxy M31s houses the 3.5mm headphone jack, the USB Type-C port, and the speaker hole. Several phones in this segment have retained the 3.5mm headphone jack, and it’s good to see that Samsung has, too. The phone does not have any official claims on water or dust resistance, which also isn’t an uncommon omission at this price range.The Samsung Galaxy M31s comes with the Exynos 9611 SoC that employs 4 ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz and 4 ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.7GHz. If this configuration sounds familiar to you, that is because Samsung has shipped several devices with the same setup, including the Galaxy A50, Galaxy A51, Galaxy M30s, and the Galaxy M31. The only “upgrades” that Samsung has afforded from the Galaxy M31 to the Galaxy M31s is the fact that the latter comes with 128GB of storage as standard and gets an 8GB RAM option.The Samsung Galaxy M31s runs on Android 10 with One UI Core 2.1 on top, which is an upgrade as its predecessor runs One UI Core 2.0. One UI Core is a stripped-down version of the complete One UI experience that is present on Samsung flagships, and Samsung ships this “Core” version on its budget and lower mid-range devices. The Core variant loses out on features such as Samsung Pay and Secure Folder. You also lose out on the system-wide built-in screen recorder, though a workaround for that is to add the app you want to screen record to the Samsung Game Launcher which allows you to screen record in games.HENCE THE BEST IN CLASS BEST IN PRICE

  This might be a little disappointing for those who prefer price per rupee valued phones. The only significant achievement is a 6000mAh battery.Bought it on 24 August, 2020 and had it delivered bumped, i. e., the cover was dented considerably and also was different from normal Samsung phone boxes because it was stickered hastily and the print of specs on the back was gone too.After using it for 2 days i returned it back because the only plus side of the phone is:-*6000mAh battery*S-Amoled Display*Clean Samsung ONE UI.The disadvantage were however plenty :*Price Is Too Costly (Almost 20k) but offers no significant edge over competition except the 1000mah higer battery.*Heats upon often very soon.*Speakers sound strangely hollow and weird, as if its located inside the phone at the center with some sort of solid cover. There's a small portion of the phone at the bottom that vibrates in a funny manner.*No back cover or  screen protector. Gorilla Glass 3 only in front side  and can withstand only light drops*No P2i protection*Strictly average gaming performance*Occasionally lags even in normal use.*Exynos 9611 processor is strictly for basic use and scores below Snapdragon 675,712 or Helio P90 and G90T*****CONCLUSION *******Buy only if you are a diehard Samsung Fan, Needs Large Battery, Good Display and Basic Uses Like Browsing And Social Media

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after using the product for more than 2 months.Generally, mobile users prefer the following things. They areBattery LifeDisplayCamera and Picture QualityCall qualitySoundQuality of the productSo I am writing my review based on the aforementioned factors.Battery Life: Really good and I don't think any other product in this price segment matches this product. Those who prefer better battery life can obviously choose this product.Display: This phone will offer you the best display which you cant expect from other smartphones in this price segment.Camera Quality: Both front and rear cameras are extremely good at sunlight conditions. But the performance of the camera under low light is moderate and it needs to be improved.Call Quality: Neither so good nor bad. You can expect the quality of what the other branded cell phone offers.Sound: In the product specification they will tell like Dolby digital. But in reality, I don't find any difference in the sound quality and I am certain to say that those claims are fake and only for commercial purposes.Quality of the product: Here I mention the built quality. It is really good. But the biggest drawback is its processor (Exynos 9611). This is a very old processor and smartphones like Realme, Oppo, Vivo, and MI phones offer better processors in this price range.  This is how they managed to offer the phone at this price (At the cost of reducing the quality). I played some games like wildscapes without any issues. But as a computer professional, I would say the phone will certainly irritate you when you play games that demand more clock cycles. So, if you are a user who loves to play games with more graphics don't go for this product and you check the processor to suit your needs.Fingerprint sensors: I would say OK and not excellent. When you have little sweat or even a slight amount of water in your hand you need to try more times to unlock the device.So I prefer to suggest this product for those who do not use computationally intensive applications, love to take photographs and watch online movies. This phone is ideal for moderate and occasional users. The product would certainly disappoint those who spent more time with smartphones and love to play games with more graphics.  The choice is up to you.

  I have read a lot of reviews before buying this product also i have searched and watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding this Samsung Galaxy M31s, Now i am writing my honest  opinion about this product:REASONS TO BUY THIS PRODUCT :1. Super Amoled Plus display, which gives the best experience for streaming videos and watching HD content, also gives the device a premium look  while using it (looks like flagship mobile ).2. Massive 6000mah battery with 25W fast charger, which cannot be compared with any other brands right now under even 30 k price range with all round features. ( battery backup and charging is just amazing )3. the User interface is just so friendly and clean (using this mobile feels like using 70 k mobile )4. Not a chinese brand ( made in india)5. one of the best all rounder cameras ( wide angle lens is the best under 20k price range ), other cameras are same like the competing phones with 20k price range.6. No back and indisplay fignerprint scanner which is just awesome as the finger print scanner at back reduces the luxury of of mobile and the inbuilt finger print scanner is not that good and can stop working after few damages or falls to the screen.7. look of mobile is also very satisfying the back panel looks like glass and gives a premium look EXTRAS : 3.5 mm jack , dedicated sd card slot 512 gb , assistant feature like iphone ,etc WHO SHOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS DEVICE :1. Gamers : this mobile is not made for hardcore gamers, but for light gamers and social media apps usage this mobile is perfect because of battery and clean ui ( so gamers dont purchase it)2. NRI and people who visit foreign : this device only supports indian sim cards so no foreign sim card would work in this device so better take care( i travel internationally, so i i have to take a extra handset with me now)3. front camera is average, not best ( front camera is 7/10 ) but considering other features it is ok4. a bit thick phone although doesnt feels too much thick ( just 2mm more thick than average mobiles.)CONCLUSION : should definitely go for it ( excluding gamers). best mobile under 20KAmazon services : Delivered before the scheduled delivery date and everything is in good conditionand people receiving damaged goods need not to worry you can return it without any problem ( there are exceptions always)

  Worst Mobile. Don't trust and buy Samsung phones. So many issues and problems in the phone. I got this phone on Sunday 27.09.2020.There is Bluetooth connectivity issue in the phone. After connecting it stucks and don't play songs, videos etc. consistently and gets disconnected continuously and sound is not coming smoothly. Music is continuously getting hanging. While playing  songs on Bluetooth speakers when I use Gmail Facebook  Whatsapp etc. Apps  the music/songs hangs and stop playing music and songs can not run smoothly. I am very very disappointed to see this that I cannot  enjoy my favorite music and songs. When you start typing  to text message the music stops. When you open any app music stops. This phone has major problems. I didn't try camera as I did get stuck in the Bluetooth Connectivity problem from the very beginning.It has 6 gb RAM but it is hanging from the first time I set up this phone.  I am a music lover I use Bluetooth headphones  and Bluetooth  home theater speakers very much and I am very very disappointed  after buying  this phone. After contacting Amazon they told me to wipe data and reboot phone but after doing this also the Bluetooth  connectivity problem persists.The same Bluetooth home theater speakers working smoothly and fine with my old phone  Lenovo k4 note and my wife's  phone realme 3 pro and my mom's phone Nokia  5.1 plus but this phone cannot play music after  connecting it to Bluetooth speakers. Inspite of having octa core processor Phone is hanging also while I did not install too much apps and did not install any single game. Worst mobile purchase in my whole life. I am regretting my decision to trust and buy Samsung m31s. I should have purchased realme or redmi or vivo or oppo. So guys don't purchase Samsung phones.Network data speed also slow as compared  to realme and redmi phones. Face recognition  and finger print reader is also not working as should have worked. The biggest  drawback is Bluetooth connectivity  which is mostly used by mobile users to call and to listen songs and to watch videos.Please Don't buy and save your money. I am going to return this phone and get my money refunded because I don't want any replacement of Samsung  phone back in my hands.  I could not give 0 ratings that's why I am giving 1 star rating. I am completely dissatisfied from the performance  of this phone.Total waste of time and money. I wasted my whole day to adjust this Bluetooth  problem but failed.Amazon please help me.

  Just telling you the  observation after receiving it and used it for sometime :1) Upper body is getting heated during software update,heavy usage.Lower body comparatively normal.2) Battery life is way too good.Used it for 2 hours, and battery is 94%.3) As its power button is fingerprint scanner, you have to set it carefully, means touch the scanner with every part of your finger, otherwise you can see slight problem unlocking it.4) Charging is super fast. When i received the product, the juice was 48%. I plugged it at 44%. It took only approx 1 hour to 100%.Hope these help.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s marks a small upgrade in the design language that Samsung has employed in its M-series lineup so far. While the basic plastic look and feel of the device remain largely the same as its predecessors, the Galaxy M31s opts for a gradient coloring on the back which gives the device its own identity. The Mirage Black unit that we received starts off with a silver-chrome color towards the top and merges into a black color towards the bottom. The chrome color is a little difficult to capture on camera, and the gradient is a lot more gradual in the middle than what the device renders suggest. The back also has a glossy finish.The Samsung Galaxy M31s initially does not feel cheap, however, in my short period of use, I found that the phone had already picked up small scratches on the back. These micro-scratches are on the edge of the flat surface of the back (the phone has a hint of a curve around the edges). If the phone can get this scratched so easily in less than a week of use, I have little confidence in how it will fare over a longer period of time. I had similar experiences with the Honor 20i which employed similar build materials, but glass-backed devices have not posed this problem for me. The glossy finish also makes the Galaxy M31s a fingerprint magnet. Further, Samsung does not include any case or cover in the box with the Galaxy M31s, so I would highly recommend purchasing a good case for the phone.

  I was looking for a phone for my mum from quite a long time ...then I found this ... everything in this phone justifies it's price ...battery of 6000mah is nice ..no one offers such big batteries ..tho weight balance of the handset is also good ...Build quality is not the best in the segment but decent ..at least better than other phones of Samsung ...camera is the best part ..as there is Sony imx sensor in it ..well done Samsung ....front camera is of 32mp..& back camera is a quad(4) camera setup ....both front & back camera supports 4k recording...& Samsung's new introduced feature called single take where you can click 10photos & videos in one go ....side mounted fingerprint is fast as hell...no lag or anything was seen in daily usage ... Android one UI is awesome ...AMOLED display with punchy colors & punch hole display for front camera looks stunning ..great for daily usage experience ..there's also famous Samsung knox security ...design & colour of the phone is also good...in front there is gorilla glass 3 & in back there's a newly introduced glastic material which is combination of plastic & glass which looks good but is a fingerprint magnet & gets dirty very quickly so better use a backcase along with ....speakers are good ..there is dualsim support with expandable memory using sd card ...25watt charger with type c cable is offered which supports reverse charging .. means u can use your phone as a power bank also ..although there was no back cover offered with the handset which was disappointing ..every brand offers a silicon backcase with their handset ...packing quality was looking cheap ..very cheap...Samsung could do much better .  Specially after what the image this brand is holding in the market ...processor is not that strong for gamers ...otherwise it does all the needful job for rest of the customers...I did a lot of research before buying this product ...& This fulfilled all the needs & requirements for my mum ...please don't let those YouTubers fool you by saying that processor is weak so phone is not good or so ....we only need good processor for very heavy usage & gaming . If you're not in one of those category you should probably pay more attention to rest of the more important day-to-day  features..like the UI, SECURITY,CAMERA QUALITY, PHONE WEIGHT ,INHAND FEEL & LOOKS ,SMOOTHNESS ,GOOD DISPLAY,SENSORS,SPEAKERS, ANDROID VERSION ,ETC...I bought mirage blue 6gb variant for 19500 in the first launch sale in prime days on 6th August 2020

  Happy about the Amazon delivery, arrived one day before expected last date. And my opinion about the phone is I'm not fully satisfied with samsung. I'll tell you why.Pros about the phone:Camera is very good at this priceS. Amoled display is off the chartsVery very good for normal useFinger print censors are very responsive and efficientCons:Even though I said camera is very good there is little problem with it. When you use the rear camera for video shooting, there is a little focusing problem. It is constantly changing the focus. But I already knew that seeing the other reviews. But if you're buying this phone for camera... well don't. I hope samsung will fix this with a update.This phone could've been used for more than ""normal"" use if the battery is as it is. Because I still don't feel like its a 6000mAh. It is still like a normal 4500mAh battery.I mean I don't even play games and still its like that and that's disappointing to be honest.There is no tpu case. Why dude why? It took me soo long to get a back cover for this phone and by that time there was some scratches in my phone. They really should've given a tpu case.The reason why I bought this phone is because I needed a non- Chinese phone under 20000. Or else by this time I would've bought m51. Overall its not a bad phone but its still not phone as I expected.

  Like most of the buyers, spent many days comparing one plus nord and this one before finally picking on it and ordered on prime day which was a good deal. Writing this review after using the phone for a month now:1. Display - Very good. Samsung is expert in that2. Camera - Has lots of features. Liked Single take mode. Also, detects documents and gives an option to scan. So no need to have additional app to scan documents.3. Call quality - No issues observed. I am using an Airtel Sim4. Software - I am not a gamer. I use MS Outlook, teams etc and no issues faced. However, on low battery level, faced issue in connecting incoming calls sometimes. Hopefully it gets resolved in some update.5. Battery - I am a heavy mobile user and need to charge it once in 24-36 hours. Which I would consider to be okay.  No complaints, but don't feel the exception of having 6000 MaH.6. Built - Back is slippery and I suggest using a phone cover. I am using one. Look and feel is premium.7. Touchscreen and fingerprint - Works fine. Face reco also works okay.Overall, I suggest to go for this phone if you are looking for one in this range. Would need to see how this phone performs after a year or so. I expect Samsung to be better than Chinese counterparts in longevity and may be, would write another review then!!

  Samsung surely disappointed with pure integration of hardware and software. These mobiles are simply over and over priced.Occasionally it hangs and restarts automatically.  Not sure whether one ui captures the bug automatically.I must say don't expect the performance, it is clearly evident throughout the usage.Display is awesome and fingerprint is faster and but not accurate after two months of usage.Battery Performance is as expected from 6K mAmp (one full day)Camera features are good but ignore the macro.Lags, buffering, display frame drops are clearly evident.The biggest selling point is non Chinese. Otherwise it is over priced.Atleast gorilla5 protection  with SD processor would have justified the price and user satisfaction.  Frankly, I had gone with this just because a non Chinese. I DON'T recommend samsung phones to anyone anymore.

  Amazing product . Its really very interesting and useful product. It's all rounder only the thing where the Samsung should improve is that Samsung should use gorilla glass 5 instead of 3 and should increase the number of tools in cell box such as headset or give free the level u with it 😜 but really it should be there with it and also protection glasses of front screen, back protection cover and camera protection cover also and the pricing also should be less  and also fingerprint reader should be mounted b'coz when we put the cover in that case sometimes the fingerprint reader is unable to read the fingerprint. The rest amazing.If u want u can go for it . For sure its amazing.

  Ordered my M31s in the sale on the 10th of Aug and get my phone around 28th of Aug owning to the very high demand. I got the phone for 19500 with my SBI Card on 3 months interest free EMI.I have been using the phone of almost a week now and the best pars are as follows:The battery is absolutely brilliant. The phone fully charges in around 80-90 minutes. A full charge with fairly decent usage will last easily for over a day. On normal days my phone is at 40% battery at the end of the day.Huge 8GB RAM is enough for multitasking.128GB storage is good.The camara is great and has no lags. The colors are vivid and clarity is amazing.The phone is a bit bulky and looks premium.The screen is bright and the display is amazing.

  When it comes to battery life, this phone's the BOSS! I use my phone for 13-15 hours a day due to my work and hobbies. But I don't even exhaust half the battery and it charges quickly. The camera is pretty amazing too, my family loves taking photos with this phone. The only drawback would be that it's heavier than many other mobiles, so it can get tiring to hold it for several hours.

  So here is my review after using the phone for 11days.. If you want a very good camera go for it , this definitely fulfills all your desires . Battery is good lasts for 1and half days and more . Charging is very fast. Sound quality  is high.  I purchased this set after using redmi for 3 years .  This phone satisfied my needs. I don't play games so I can review about that.. only one thing I didn't liked is , it has hybrid slim slot.  One sim + one memory card at a time  or 2 sim at a time.  But though it has a big memory  128gb it will not create any problem.. But I recommend  this phone to everyone.  👌

  After heavily using Samsung M31s for 20 days,  I writing this review.Pros:1. Camera Quality is really excellent. Both front and rear camera is performing nice even in night or low light. It is able to take clear image than what we can see from our naked eyes in low light.2. Battery performance is good. It lasts for 1 and half day after heavy using.3. I like the pre-installed softwares such as Microsoft Office with full features such as converting pdf to word etc. Now Most of my office work is completed through this phone only.4. One more feature, screenshot. In single click, it can take a big screenshot of larger document by auto scrolling down the document.5. Camera is using artificial intelligence, if you will take a pic of a document. It automatically scan that doc like CamScanner.6. I really like its SINGLE TAKE feature. It captures photos and videos of the best event at a same time.Cons:While playing heavy games, I feel a little bit lagging.Overall I am very happy after buying this phone.

  Till just the last generation samsung mid-range smartphones used to be just plain useless and outdated at the time of their launch.But they finally have done mid-range smartphone right. It has awesome camera(both front and back) and the crisp Amoled display is samsung speciality and once you start using it all other display in same category just seems dull. Only issue I have had is with the fingerprint reader it works 80% of the time, even if you have a little sweat or oil in your hand then it just does't recognize it. Other expects of this phone are amazing I don't game on smartphone much but it handled low - medium fine but at high settings it starts to get tosty and lagy. But my favorite thing about it is its battery life even if I watch 8Hrs of youtube it still lasts me a full day and extra (32-36Hrs) and mutitasking is ammzing you won't find it lag anywhere thanks to 8gb of ram and optimized  samsung one UI. Most people don't think about it, But it also just looks cool and premium and is a treat to use. So I suggest if you are in market for a good non-chinese smartphone and care for your privacy it is the best option available in the market at its price range.

  Hello,I have purchased m31s before one month. I am happy with the battery life, camera, finger lock. I am not happy with the processer of Mediatek. If you are looking for the general daily task then this phone is made for you but if you play games like Call of duty, PubG etc then this phone is not the right choice. If you are a gamer then go for other options. Apart from gaming performance, this phone is best for daily task.

   Earlier I was little hesitant for Samsung phone, but thought let's try for M31s. At day 1, when I copies data from other device, faces a lot of issues, even i was unable to delete my details from samsung app.,finally somehow deleted,opted factory set up. Now, almost a month,everything is fine. Changing smoothly,very fast; camera is nice. I couldn't check reverse charging,as its pin is little big then others. Personal assistant is very helpful, no need to press any button, even in case of power off/restart. Nice display. Video runs good, like Amazon prime movies. But, a lot of add is displaying in the screen while running other videos,like MX player. Finger print is running ok, plus point here is- when a call/msg whatsapp comes while working, no need to pick the phone, just touch side, it's quite helpful. Battery life is very good. It's worth full. Metallic frame, smooth; sound is loud and good. FM radio is upto the mark, may be I am comparing this with my Boofer. So many facilities are there,  maybe I have used 30-40% of total. For everything, have to check YouTube, as there's no guide book with the mobile.

  I was bit confused by various comments before purchase. But the use of one full day, here is my feedback.- Clear and very crisp display.- Rear camera picture quality is good, satisfied. Sometime it recommends to switch to 64MP. The size of the image is ~14Mb.- Front camera picture is also great. Videos are amazing even in low light.- Single shot feature is amazing- Battery backup is good. Initial charging from 52% to 100% took 60 mins.- There was a heat up problem at the top backside of the device. But fortunately, after the first s/w update, the problem has gone. No heat up problem after that. But i have not used GPS yet.- UI is amazing. Android 10 v2.1 is a good. Many features. Will take time to learn all of them- Sound quality is very good.- Preinstalled with many required apps (but there are still a few unwanted apps which can be uninstalled)- It is not that heavy, phone size is also large, however it can be easily fit into the palm.- Little glossy backside, There is a chance of slipping from hand, probably a back cover would be useful.Overall, it's a good experience so far. Value for money. Go for it...

  It's battery life and charging technology is amazing according to the brand value I highly recommend to everyone but keep this in mind that it's fingerprint scanner is decent I think it can improve a bit and face lock really need to improve , it can improve its timing when we change it's setting but giving a warning that it can be opened by a picture or a video of the registered person and other issue which I found very noticeable that when we zoom a selfie it makes the picture blur I don't know why this is happening because I put the screen guard just after unboxing because there is a gorrila glass 3 protection which is liittle disappointing and just like it's protection the polycarbonate back and processor can be improved they improved it in their new phone in M series which is M51 but it's price is on higher side means it's a premium midrange smartphone I suggest who can afford 5 to 6 thousand more can buy M51 with improved processor and battery was lit 🔥 🔥🔥 in both M31s ans M51 , 6000 mAh and 7000 mAh respectively I prefer to buy M51 who can afford and can also buy M31s which I am using and satisfied from it. 🙂🙂

  This is the best phone so far in such a affordable price😍😍. There are multiple reasons why you should go for this phone: Firstly it's of samsung brand which is purely made in India. It has the best features in such a affordable price rangeIt's gradient design is so delightful.It is having the  64 mp intelli camera with single take and has ultra wide camera which makes every shot frame worthy and also we can create upto 99 cool custom filters .It is  having sony sensor IMX682 camera which is so great.It has 6000 mah battery and it's battery charging is just amazing which comes with 25w fast charger .Its  screen ratio is greater than 91% and aspect ratio is 2:9 which gives immersive viewing experience with minimal interruption.After having such a great features what else do we need in our phone.processor octa core (samsung exynos 9611) is great speedy and 6 gb ram is moreenough for speed and 128 gb data storage is more enough for any bodyMy advice is just buy this phone without thinking because it is having thebest features which we  can rarely find at this range.

    Good but not great

  The whole design principle of this phone is flawless, the relatively small punch hole in the center, more squared off front profile, consistent and thin borders, manageable bulge in square camera housing.The display panel is signature ""Samsung"", but even the Normal color profile looks fantastic on this panel.For my layman usage, Camera quality seems great.Battery life can be summarized as ""2 day battery"", considering mixed on and off screen usage. But the inclusion of 25W charger in box is the deal maker for those who worry about endurance practical usage.Fingerprint reader is not as practically good as it is technically excellent. The whole idea of side mounted scanner, that too on embedded in the power button, is neither intuitive as rear mounted, nor versatile as under display scanner. But it's fast, expected of the final generation capacitive scanner.One UI is great if you are coming from other non stock options, but headache inducing when you come from stockish phones like OnePlus.I cannot say for sure whether for the price it's the best deal. But it's not immediately regretted. It's a well rounded square phone.

  Last 12 years I am using Samsung phones and this one is the best. The battery life, charging speed, camera (front & back), processing speed in all the areas, this is the best product within this price range.I have already recommended this phone to my family and friends.Another good thing is the price of this phone in Amazon is lesser than any reputed shop in Kolkata.Go for it.

  Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAMHonest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than 1 month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  In every Image....Everyone can see that....The Samsung 64MP camera is excellent....The dynamic range is super...eventhough the Macro shots are perfect with less noise....I am using the phone for 3 weeks....till now and the battery last for 2days and even 2 and half days with minimal usage...The Power button which acts as an fingerprint sensor is smooth and fast...and unlocks your device fast...and the Face unlock is also really fast....The one UI 2.1 is Fantastic and gives smooth experience....The Single Shot is new to the M series is really wow....The only thing that matters is the processor....Exynos 9611...which is a midrange Chip...but it is faster for midrange user and it also runs Heavy games smooth with no lags....The speaker is absolutely 💯 powerful...Thanks to Dolby Atmos...The Next thing is the eye catching Super Amoled Infinity O Display.....The backs are rich...and the phone has HD content display Certified which allows you to stream HD content from Amazon Prime and Netflix....It has both Fornt and Rear 4K video recording capability at 30fps...Thanks to the 25watts fast charger on the Box...which is really fast...and it takes 95-105 min to fully charge your device from 0-100...Overall rating for Samsung M31s is 9.7 out of 10.

    Please Don't Buy this. Horrible processor and a pathetic camera and worst face unlock
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The processor is very weak as it takes time to respond in every app opened. The camera is a failure as it does not capture nearby things having object nearby and with background depth until macro is selected. The face unlock is horrible as it hardly responds. Putting the fingerprint reader on the side is a disgusting idea as that area is not a ergonomically correct area. I wasted my money and striving to get it returned as the return policy does not allow you return or refund.

  Throw any number of apps on it, it works very smoothly without any lag, buffering etc.. Screen sharpness ..too good even in sunlight , it rather gets accentuated and  pictures by default  looks brighter and sharper. Perfect clear loud sound quality distinctly clearer than Samsung M 30S . 6000mAH battery charging phone from zero to 100 % level in around 110-120 mins and then forget for two days ... run you tube, WhatsApp, Outlook, Gmail, PowerPoint ,Excel or Telly erp 9.0 or whatever .. it handles them with utter  ease .The camera quality and Bluetooth connectivity from  earbuds to stand-alone Speakers  is excellent. Video graphy quality is pretty good coour of objects photographed or video graphed is quite close to original one! All four cameras are doing great job.The size in holding in hand and working single handedly  is with ease . DOES NOT WAARM up either on charging or while playing You Tube content for a longer period. it gives run for money to more expensive Chinese sets . Greates assurance is the prompt after sales if required ven for any big or small issue ,if it all happens. I bought on-line from Amazon ... Perfect  Packaging  with charger , charger wire, manual were in the box, The moment I switched on after charging for 45 mins put in all my credentials, it became ALIVE MUCH to my satisfation and using Samsung Smart Switch , the data from old Samsung Phone Galaxy J7 Prime 3GB RAM & 16GB INTERNAL STORAGE plus Samsung Evo Class 10 64 GB Micro SD card  was transferred to the new phone Samsung Galaxy M31S with 8GB RAM & 128 GB INTERNAL STORAGE with Samsung EVO Plus  128 GB microSDXC card  in around 45 mins to 60 mins max.i booked it on Aug 10,2020 and received on Aug 16,2020.That point in time to date I have been using without any complaint for slow functioning or heating issues even when  30 apps are concurrently running.this phone loves to be used extensively . since purchase, I have received two updates as well which has further improvised the UI of the phone towards better.My personal rating  for this phone  Model # SM-M317F/DS is 5 Stars . I am a highly satisfied customer and user of this phone.Vinod Sharda

  Hey, I have been using this phone for a week now and it's been terrific till now( My model is 6gb RAM-128gb Storage, mirage blue ), so here's a quick review abt the phone: -• Camera quality is a piece of art in this price range, great work by Samsung in sharpening of photos and not oversaturating it.• It doesn't have a battery, it has battera !! Yes you read it correctly ie you can charge other phones by this phone.• Side mounted finger print works great, opens in snap of a sec.• The salient features are great like the pop-up screen, single take(camera), lock app screen and lots other.Not to mention you get a headphone jack here which you won't get in any one plus at iPhones!• Coming on to the screen display, it's done a fantastic job by providing a super amoled infinity display, you get to see colour detailing and it's richness on the next level(if you love to binge watch and surf YouTube go for it).• It comes with a glastic body and the body material used is quite impressive, gives a sleeky and rich look, personally I loved it's design!• It comes with a punch hole front camera which makes its design more appealing.• It's not a 5G phone but still I think, if you are in India you don't need to buy one that supports 5G, I don't see it coming for the next 1 yr, plus the net plans of 5G won't be affordable for a general man, so fir next 2-3 yrs you don't have to look for 5G(It's from my point of view, rest you can dig up a bit on chrome).• Honestly speaking 6gb RAM should do your work, but depending on the kind of apps you use you can always opt for 8gb RAM.• The only con is that it's not meant for heavy gaming, for that you can look for other phones with high refresh rate and good Snapdragon processor.

  Please have a look at the below observations –Pros –1. Samsung Knox security is the most important feature of this device. I was fortunate to be protected by this security when some fraud team wanted to take access of my device via some team viewer apps. They posed as PayTM agents and wanted to take control of my mobile for KYC updation. As I had granted them permission, Samsung Knox security blocked the access. Hopefully this feature will protect other users also. I don’t think this security feature is available in any Chinese brand.2. Display is awesome. It is the best in market in this price range.3. Sound quality of the speaker and loudspeaker is excellent and also voice clarity of the microphone is good enough. Sound quality via earphones is also good.4. Quality of both rear and front cameras are quite good.5. Battery performance is decent although it takes 2 hours and 10 minutes for full recharge instead of 97 minutes as advertised.6. Looks like a premium phone.Cons –1. My PC is unable to detect mobile hotspot of this device. However it is detected by other PCs or devices. Both Samsung service center and customer care are unable to solve this issue. Can anybody assist to overcome this problem?2. Processor (Exynos 9611) – Performance is decent but not recommended for Gamers. Other manufacturers are providing latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processors in this price range or less.3. Side mounted fingerprint sensor. In-display fingerprint sensor was expected in this price range.4. Back cover was expected to be glass instead of plastic, considering the price.5. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (which is back dated) is provided instead of the latest option available.Finally - Highly recommended over any Chinese brand.

  The perfect value for money Samsung phone i have ever seenLooks wise it is looking like s20 series when you applied a good caseBattery is beast ! and also 25w charger is good enough 25w charger from Samsung in this price segment is more than enough !Camera,here Samsung goes very aggressively by giving tough competition to other brandsback camera gives very good details and natural colours 64+12+5+5 is good combination rather than giving 2 mp useless cameras(good move)Samsung provides some flagship features in camera like single take animoji etc.,Front camera is also goodDesign wise it is ok front glass is gorilla glass version 3 which is very old version it is better if Samsung gave 5th version of gorilla glassback is glasstic looking good but attracting finger prints here Samsung bundles 6000mah huge battery but also it feels like a 4000mah battery means weight management is done very well(👍)Lets talk about processorAs my day to day ussage i didn't notice any kind of lags and shutters because of the UI is very well optimized with processor and i didn't notice any kind of heatingI'm not a gamer but i play some games like Real cricket and i didn't notie any lags overall processor department is above averagefor a regular user processor is more than enough ! no need to worry!Lets talk about software,One UI seems good it has many features like call recorder etc.. but Samsung need to add a native Screen recorder and app lock which are very useful waiting for these two from One UiPricing is ok as it is Samsung brandedOverall very very good mobile from SamsungBut it blindly ! rather than buying any other Chinese brands**Good quality back case recommend**

    Good phone at this price range

  It's a pretty good phone, especially considering the price. I got the 8GB version for close to 20k during the sale and have been using it for about a month and a half now.Now, on to the details.First the pros:1. The display is good. The size, colours and response are all good.2. Very good battery life. I have been using it continuously and it easily survives a day with heavy usage.3. It has a headphone jack.4. Decent camera.5. Decent speakers.6. Good grip.Cons:1. It's a bit bulky and heavy. I didn't realise just how much till I compared it with my old LGv30+. That one seems like a slim piece of light glass compared to this phone. Not that it will be a problem for everyone but it's something that you should consider.2. It comes with all the usual Samsung crap bundled in. You can uninstall/disable most of it but you'll get notifications about the Samsung Store every now and then.3. The side mounted fingerprint reader is more miss than hit. I really prefer the back mounted fingerprint readers like the one in LGv30+. The side button is just too small for accurate reading IMO.4. It doesn't come with a headset/earphone. Not sure why I expected one to be bundled with it but I guess it's my first mid-range phone so there's that.5. The exynos chip is a bit slower than the snapdragon one. The performance is good so far but I won't be surprised if it slows down a bit with time.6. The camera is decent but it can glitch out sometimes during the post processing and turn the image dark.7. The touch responsiveness on the screen is average compared to the more high-end devices.All in all, it's a good buy at this price range.

  I got my Samsung M31s Mirage Black 8 GB - 128 GB version around 2 weeks ago. The first impression I have about the phone is a big W-O-W.It's really an advance age cool device. Couple of points I would like to highlight are:The coolest features:- Design , its an awesome device,feels wonderful to hold in hand-Entertainment- OMG the colors and display makes its an out of the world experience to watch the shows on OTT.- Weight , given the specifications like 6k mh battery, screen size etc. It feels like holding a feather.- Camera- can't go any better than this. The modes to capture allows to take the photography to the next level. And I would say a professional photography not mobile photography.- Power - It charges pretty fast with superfast charger 25w type c cable- Biometrics- The idea to keep the fingerprint scanner on right side just worked gaga. I realized that this the place where usually the hand goes un-consciously. Samsung has done a good job in research and place the scanner on side. Believe me its going to be a trend setter for future designsOther Cool features:- The screen size is so accommodating with arranging multiple apps- The virtual mobile assistant is an advantage if you wish to run on one handCould have been cooler:- I wish Samsung could have provided its headphones along with the device. Not sure why they discontinued to tag along. I really miss the sound quality and ergonomic design of the original Samsung headphones. But no worries it goes along so well with any of your leading wired or wireless headphones.  So you may enjoy your entertainment at full.Hope you have found this review helpful.Cheers,

    THE MOST HONEST REVIEW FOR GALAXY M31 S:
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  An honest review for the galaxy m 31s:First of all the phone feels a bit heavy when you pick it up for the first time but then gradually it grows on you.Build quality:The build quality feels great and the shaded back gives an entirely different premium feeling.Screen quality:For just 22k this phones seems to have the best, s-AMOLED display which will continue to dazzle you across the journey. Although the screen feels a bit pale when compared to tfts and other AMOLED display but other than being slightly pale, it will provide prolific experience on a regular day to day basis.Fingerprint position:This reminded me of sony's little innovation in Xperia but it surely is way better than the one in Sony. It is switchable as in you can control the Fingerprint sensor by switching it off it'll work as a power button all the times except when you need to unlock your phoneCamera:My oh my! The camera quality is too good for a 22k phone. The beast primary lens along with the wide angle  gives the best shots you can think of. The depth sensor also does its  job in a serene manner.As you can see from the shots the colours are also the same. The features in the camera reminded me of the first apple or Sony camera phones. Too many and too awesome!Battery:Well, I'd rather not comment on the battery as its power tells it already. It just doesn't want to drain. Wow, Samsung a real good one.Front camera position:The a51 and a 71 style camera gives the pho e a premium view plus you won't even notice it while watching a video.Samsung UI:Oh my god! I never expected this perfection from Samsung during the early stages of s series but the way they have included everything, it just makes addicted to itself.Ram and storage:The ram management is a beauty on this device though I'm using an 8 gb variant. The internal storage is ample but for the ones who like to maintain an eternal collection of songs, clicks and videos, it also provides a dedicated memory card slot to give you collection a platform.Exynos:Samsung should have tried to give this phone a better processor than the exynos 9 series that too an old one that comes in almost all devices except for the flagships. There is a need to understand that a better processor is the need of the hour. Apart from certain lags it's just.Sound:Surround sound in headphones or speakers is the best in the market. In headphones or ear plugs it'll take you to a concert live. No worries in the sound department.Last but not the least guys this device has an audio jack to feel that vintage music zeal.So overall, this phone is a complete package under 20k and it feels so good in hands. Surely a Beauty!

  Performance:The Galaxy M31s is powered by Samsung’s in-house Exynos 9611 chipset. There were no issues with the phone when carrying out regular activities such as streaming, gaming, and multi-tasking as well. Your day-to-day experience, which would involve the opening of multiple apps in the background or browse through several tabs opened on Chrome should not face any hindrance.Build Quality:The Samsung Galaxy M31s has a somewhat new design that makes it stand out compared to its siblings in the Galaxy M series. It gets a 6.5-inch Infinity-O display with a hole-punch embedded camera centred at the top.Display:The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display. The display offers wide viewing angles and the larger screen makes watching movies/series and playing games a delight. Also, it has a blue light filter which reduces the strain on the eyes. There is also an option of dark mode.Fingerprint:This time Samsung has gone with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy M31s, which is on the right along with the volume buttons. Battery:The Galaxy M31s offers good battery life and lasted for close to two full days with my usage.Camera:The Samsung Galaxy M31s sports a quad-camera setup. The 64-megapixel primary camera has an f/1.8 aperture. There's also a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There is also a scene optimiser in the app.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs. 20,000.Thank you, Amazon for on-time delivery. Such a great experience!

  Hello everyone,  Toh kaise hai Aap log....,ok..This is a review from my side for The #monstershot M31s This is a superior mobile i can said.I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable. Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive. Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there but does the job. Nothing to complain about..Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around....5. Fingerprint scanner is decent......Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster....6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered. Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery....No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market...7.I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.I think this is enough review from my side..Just Go For It...brother...just wow phone...ta ta...😀😀

  Samsung provides everything as promised. It's inteli cam is awesome saves alot of effort....battery is monstrous. Ram management, performance, display and all other features are awesome. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate....its doesn't have any cons, like some of the features are missing when compared to S20 and all, but you can't expect any flagship features in midrange phones....overall this mobile gives you a flagship level of experience under midrange.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy use. Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though it is made of glass. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5. Battery: monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional email checking, light gaming and social media browsing. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course the reverse charging and super fast charging support. It took about 100 to 120 minutes to fully charge the phone from 0 to 100. 5/5. Camera: one of the best if not the best camera in this line. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some of the functionality of the intelli camera. 4.5 / 5. Processor and UI: During the last 3 days I have been using this phone the UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I'm an android lover so luckily i was able to remove a few preinstalled apps and block ads / app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like the smart pop-up view that are really awesome. The processor was lag-free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on the game because I'm not a heavy player. Overall a great choice for everyday use. 4.5 / 5. Display: no comments. Only 5/5. The only disappointment I had was that there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. As for the price, when I compared it to the competition for the 6 / 128GB variants, there was a difference of 1k at 1500 which seemed good to me considering the Samsung brand and the features offered. I would recommend this one if someone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.

    An Experience Overview of M31s
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I Bought M31s on 18th September and I'm satisfied with the product. This phone is great for those who don't play games often (yea coz of the generic Exynos chipset). But for light users, you don't have to worry about the performance (It's pretty much enough).The camera - Rear cam is great but... BUT the front camera doesn't give the feel like its 32MP, I was able to notice more noise in the images but in daylight with proper lighting the image comes pretty good (It's okay-ish still it could have been much better).The fingerprint reader is amazingly fast and you'll get used to it after using it for a day or two.The speakers are great!The Battery (which is the beast) got to be the best selling point for this phone. It charges from 0-100% in less than 2 hours (Many companies are reducing the charging hours, but ignore that fact coz this one is a monster) it took more than 24 hours for it to drain from 100% to 0% and if you are using it for just personal use then you can expect more than that (it came for about 28 hours for me I guess).Display is another amazing thing about M31s, It is obviously expected from Samsung to give the best display in industry.  But they could have increased the screen protection by giving Corning Gorilla glass 5 (I personally felt this) So while ordering the phone don't forget to order a temper too! And a back case, yeaaa coz the back is 'glastick' which looks glossy but it can break easily so back case is a must if you have butterfingers.The weight balancing is greatly done!!The Software experience is neat. One UI is great, you'll definitely love it..So if you are a heavy user or a selfie freak or someone who things protection is important or someone who wants super-super fast charging then this phone is not recommended for you.

  After one month of heavy use i m reviewing this one... The phone looks amazing with fading back panel.Camera is astonishing, specially the wide angle camera. Brings out beautiful colour in both natural and artificial lighting.Processor is not made for extreme gaming but it can be played with medium level graphics although in long run it might affect the phone. Battery life is too good, not amazing as lately I found it draining little faster, however the battery optimization can pull the battery for more than 2 days for sure with normal usage

  The wait is over for me and I bought on Last Friday. This is my 4th phone in Samsung family. Box is packed very well and maintained social distance and also face covered with mask. Once received we sanitized the pack and opened.  Once the pack is taken and opened I'm happy to see my baby in pack.Coming to mobile, I bought a MIRAGE BLUE 6GB/128GB, the screen is compact in hand and a bit long and slim - may be by reduce in width it looks long. The logo after switch on (appearance) is good to visible compared to my previous mobile (While display company logo-Brightness is automatically increases and decreases until turns on). Display looks Super with a camera looks like a dot on screen, it's a bit uncomfort while watching and taking pictures/videos. For taking micro pictures they said keep 4cm away from object, but I say to reduce to 2cm is super. And coming to display on icons it's a bold and large looks like a fatty, yes we can change it in settings but at starting appearance is important naaa. Remaining same in all Samsung Galaxy phone. The main change is Fringer Print sensor, and I waited for this change and happy now that screen lock and sensor is same. Yeah yeah battery life is top main with 6000MAH which gives a long long life battery, it charges fast and drains slow slow that's what we want for a mobile know :) :)Finally, it's a worthy mobile for money as well as look and class. As I'm using from past many years I prefer Samsung Galaxy's. Enjoy your mobile take care with extra fittings like covers and screen guard's. Take care stay safe and stay Healthy:)

  I bought galaxy M31S on 28/08/2020, I took 15 to 30 photographs through this mobile and to my surprise it got heated up so badly that I couldn't kept it near to my ear for calling purpose. I have to kept it aside for atleat 15 min to make it cool and to use it again for calling, still temperature was not reached to normal. Some day it might blow my head and even a prolong use with such a terrible heating may also cause health complications.It is really pathetic to get such problem even after spending so much money. I was earlier disappointed with my old phone for the same problem and thought of buying Samsung but even after buying a new phone and thats too of brand like Samsung and getting the same problem is really shocking and disappointing. I want to return it and want refund for the same. I don't  know why this phone is rated so high on the Amazon. Never go by the rating. Amazon plz help 🙏

  Hello buyers!If you are here it's because you are browsing for the best smartphone for your budget.Let me help you.Samsung Galaxy M31s is the best phone for the price. period.Why you ask?Here are my thoughtsIt's a full blown media machine. It's truly impressive Super amoled display is the main reason for it. Backing it up there is an enormous 6000mAh battery with 25W super charger included in the box so that you can enjoy what ever you do seemlessly. It charges out fully drained batter to100 in 90 to 100 mins. (Ps don't drain your battery completely not good for the long run of  battery life). My experience while watching videos is freaking out of the world. Blacks are black thanks to the sAmoled display. Now let's talk about camera shall we. It's a quad camera setup primary being an wonderful 64MP and boy does it nail the picture quality. It's new intelli cam also does its job. Single take feature is very handy aswell. Wanna impress your buds with some stunning images don't worry Samsung's galaxy M31s has you covered. Oh now you want a selfie with 10 of your friends?Front facing selfie cam can do it without breaking a sweat with a wide angle for super impressive group photos also not to forget the 4K video recording on both front and back camera and also you can switch between them on-the-go. Fingerprint reader is blazing fast aswell. Overall performance is smooth and sexy. Definitely recommend. It's my first samsung product and I'm deeply impressed by the build quality as well. It gives  a premium feel in hand.

    THE BEAST SAMSUNG M31s
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is the 5th Samsung phone in our family and it has truly rocked it. I have seen many changes since my last Samsung smartphones and there has been massive up-gradations and updates. Samsung developers keep in mind the problems faced by the people and fix it at the earliest. This is the very reason I have sticked upon Samsung since a decade.Coming over to this Smartphone, it truly blends all the features in it. If battery life is what you’re after, you can’t go wrong with the M31s, packing a whopping 6,000mAh cell with Super Fast Charging with a 25 Watt charger and an added reverse charging feature. The M31s is truly a resilient phone, letting you get about two days worth of use on a single charge. While your mileage will surely vary from mine, there’s no denying that the M31s makes its case for being the king of batteries.Another thing I love about the phone is the 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, which produces excellent color accuracy and some decent black levels. It’s also quite bright, so using the phone under direct sunlight won’t be a problem. Personally, I think the screens of Samsung phones are usually a notch above other brands and the M31s is no exception.The Intellicam camera feature is the one I loved the most. In this feature when the user presses the record button, the camera records 10 seconds of video clip, and then uses Artificial intelligence to produce 10 different outputs, 7 photos and 3 videos including original video, Boomerang and Hyperlapse. This Single Take feature is present in both front and rear cameras.The first in segment the side fingerprint embedded with the power button is extremely fast. It unlocks in a flash. You wont regret it.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M31s is a solid all-around phone, with a versatile quadruple rear camera setup, an incredible display, and an extremely large battery capacity.

  I have been using samsung galaxy phone since 2019. I have been using samsung galaxy m20 which is a very good phone if we want a budget phone. To be honest, I have not found even a single issue in my samsung galaxy m20.Reasons for switching from samsung galaxy m20 to samsung galaxy m31s are following:1) I wanted to have a phone of a Super AMOLED display.Mark my word, if you buy samsung galaxy m31s phone and, after buying it, if you are not satisfied with its display quality, then throw the phone into water and write a complaint against samsung.2) I wanted a display size of exactly 6.5 inches but not more than 6.5 inches as more than 6.5 inches display size phone is not one-handed phone. Of course, a phone having more than 6.5 inches is also suits for many users. But, on an average, a display size of not more than 6.5 inches best suits for one- hand-use.3) I wanted a phone of more battery capacity.4) I wanted to buy a power bank for charging my another phone. But, samsung galaxy m31s serves me by providing me a reverse charging facility. So, I need not to buy any power bank as I have with me an excellent phone, namely samsung galaxy m31s.5) Most importantly, I wanted a phone having an excellent camera. Since, I was in need to buy a camera but after buying samsung galaxy m31s, I need not to buy any camera for my photo works as samsung galaxy itself has an excellent camera quality that I never imagined.Moreover, samsung galaxy m31s has not excellent rear camera but also an excellent front camera.6) I wanted a phone having many number of gestures control facility.

  well let me tell you some point after a week use which nobody talks about.1)network reception is worst. (Even my 3 year old phone used to get the good amount network in my office) but being this phn has newer processor as compared to SD625 it badly struggles for network.2) no heptic feedback. Bad or good is different thing but it do not have heptic feedback.3) battery is not optimized properly. Drains quickly considering 6k mah battery.4) believe me UI is very laggy. Even typing feels so much laggy. You type a letter and it appears after 2 seconds.5) software optimization is worst here.6) one UI looks good but it didn't feel good to use. Very laggy and difficult to use.7) bit of heating issue even in noraml use.8) music player gets automatically paused even after shutting off all the powe mode. (Seen many vdos to solve this on YT but not solved.)9) earpiece is very bad. It's loud but not clear.10) exynos 9611 should handle normal tasks easily but it even fails badly to even handle twitter. You will feel so much stutter scrolling the news feed.11)front camera feels like 2MP only.12) face unlock is very much slow.Lets talk some goodies.1) camera is very good. ( not used single take even once.)2) mammoth battery but charges quickly.3) Display is something which wins your heart.Final words- doesn't even feel like midrange device. Feels like enrty level device below 10k.Priced much higher than what it is delivering.

  I'm writing this review after 7 days of usage and I must say that this is the best mid range samsung smartphone If gaming is not your priority.Let's talk about main points...1. Display - It's just wow!!! Ok I'm not a gamer so obviously my priority was display so as to bingewatch my favourite shows and movies and here samsung is second to None so for display I would give 5/5.2. Camera - Camera is actually better than what I expected, the ultrawide photos are really cool and macro shots are definitely not gonna dissapoint you but don't expect much from low light performance so for camera I would give 4/5.3. Performance - Well, now things are gonna start to show some mediocrity because even though I don't play heavy games still I'm a very heavy user and I did notice some lag on Instagram after long usage So yes samsung definitely needs to upgrade the processor.. here I can't more than 3.5/5.What I liked about this phone...1- Weight distribution is really good because even after having 6000 mah it doesn't feel to heavy.2- I loved the always on display option and it also offers variety of paid and free themes for it too.3- Ui is so much classy p.s. coming from a chinese phone :p4- Camera Performance is really really good in day light conditions.What I didn't like...1- The face unlock is not very fast even though I don't use it but it could have been better.2- Performance might dissappoint you at times.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s nails the essentials which makes it a pretty well-balanced offering from the company. That includes its crisp 6.5 inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display, a huge 6000 mAh battery, 64 MP Primary camera with a Sony IMX682 sensor and a super fast side mounted fingerprint reader. The glasstic (plastic that feels like glass) back is quite good and gives it a shiny and premium look.Pros-• Huge battery life• Fast 25W charger• Great Camera• S-AMOLED displayCons-• 60 Hz refresh rate (90Hz would be better)• Exynos 9611 chipset (Snapdragon 730 or 765G would be better)•  Night mode is a bit disappointingConclusion:This is one of the best phones if you are looking to buy with a budget of less than 20000₹. Samsung could have done much better with the chipset and processor but if you don't mind that then M31s is better than all the other phones in this range.

  Have brought the 8GB/128GB variant and writing this review after one week of usage:Body:The built is solid and the device looks awesome. I have brought Mirage blue variant and the smudge effect on the back looks dope.Weight:the phone is kinda heavy, but that is expected from a device which has massive battery.Camera:The camera is okish and takes decent picture. but the results are different in different lighting conditions.Battery and Charging:The battery lasts for 2 days on a regular usage and 1 and a half day on heavy usage. have received type C to type C charging cord. the Charger is a 25W charger and charges up the device quickly.Would have been great if earphones and silicon case were included. Samsung should have also included USB to Type C cable.Overall am really satisfied with the device and highly recommend everyone to go for this device

  Overall a good phone. But sometimes fingerprints reader dosnt response at 1st attempt. Also battery dont seems like 6000mah not sure if i need to relook at my settings for better battery life. But good for daily usage.Only negative point is the processor. Other leading mobile companies are giving SD720. Even samsung sbluld have given this. But if you are not a heavy user and looking for a good budget phone for daily usage, this is the phone for you.

  First look is Awesome !!!I am using this for last 1 month now and here is my review.Pros -1. Camera - Excellent camera 64 Megapixel gives clear shots.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.3. Touch is working fine as I found lag in other samsung models but here it works pretty well.4. UI is good.5. Speaker sound is good.6. No issues in calls - No call drips using Vodafone sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before buying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor - Could have been better3 No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  A true beast by a non-chinese company. No bloat makes it cherry on the cake.New innovative finger reader is also a good move is quite fast.No need to say about camera quality its just amazing. Colours come out very good .Last but not least its battery is amazingly powerful and charger provided with this is 25 watt which makes it price justifiable.Weight is one thing you could worry about and nothing else.

The design that Samsung provides us is excellent. What to talk about the battery it's magical. The fast charger comes with this mobile works like 65 watt charger, it's super fast.

  After one month of use ,I think this is good phone for normal usage. Game like modem combat 5 is smooth. But WiFi is very slow ,I compare it with Poco F1 , Poco is super fast.Watching movies are smooth very nice. Camera is excellent. You should buy it if you want to avoid Chinese phone. As your data will be secure compare to Chinese phones.Charger is super fast.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Like It's Claim There Is No Doubt That The Battery Life Is Real Monster, When I Talk About Camera Quality It Is Good, In Daylight It Is Perform Very Well With It's 10X Zooming But In Night The Performance of Camera Is Degraded. It Can Be Solved By Improving Camera Software. There Is Also One Thing That I Noticed In This Device Is That When I Open The Applications like Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. It Runs Very Well But When I Close That Applications I Can See Some Glitch Effect On Icon Of Particular Applications. I'm Not Using Fingerprint Reader So I Don't Know How Efficiently It Is Works In This Device But Instead Of That I'm Using Facial Recognition, It Is Impressively Work Great But There Are Seen Some Poor Performance When I Try To Use In Night Or Dark Places. Overall I Can Say That It Is Really Impressive And Real Monster Device But I Improving Some Software Issues It Will Be Like 100% Real Monster.

  After all the reviews and hype I too decided to go for the Galaxy M31s...and pretty well the phone delivered quite a good performance.However Amazon seems to be too casual in selecting the sellers on it's platform. The mobile delivered to me seems to be a refurbished one with rough cuttings seen on the right screen edge as if the screen has been opened from the body. Not a happy situation considering you are buying a brand new phone....and again putting a doubt on Amazon's credibility and the sellers operating their business.The phone's specs are good for the price and the performance is OK but my 1 star is for the overall experience...

  I am still wondering how it is in top trending amd how it is best seller, here's my experience with this so called battery monster:Battery: 6000 mah battery is being consumed in 18 hrs just after normal use means only calling and hardly 10-20 min video call.Camera: ok but not like a 64mp, I have user S8 and trust me camera of S8(12MP) is far better than this so called 64+3 others.same for selfie camera also.No any good protection for glass, heating issue even after just one call.Just one positive that is screen. Other than this mobile is completely waste from samsung. I wanted to return to Samsung after seeing s8 performance and wanted to replace one of my china made by this one.But samsung disappointed me. Not going to trust samsung in near future for mid range phones

  Everything is just about perfect! Specially the Amoled, finger print reader, Face Recognition, speed, multi tasking. Don’t even talk about battery life! It’s massive! Stays up and running for 3 continuos days with moderate usage.The only thing that can be improved: camera. Not too good. Image looks grainy and artifically touched up, even after turning those settings off. Night mode works well, but grainy again. Can live with it, not too bad, but certainly can be improved. If the lighting is good, expect brilliant photos.

    Worst Samsung Phone- Dont Buy Ever
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Dear friends, reviewing about this phone after using for 15 days now. The phone look, display and sound is very good and Samsung has really done justice at the given price and will give u an awesome buyer feel.But the camera quality is poor not as per the specifications given. U cant compare the pictures taken with a shot from an One plus Nord or even from an Iphone XR.. The worst part of the phone is the software and the apps given with the phone. The phone hangs a lot even after having 8gm Ram and 128 storage😭😭😭 Whatsapp doesn't works properly in terms of downloading and forwarding. Other apps also takes long time to open and not instant at all.The battery life and sound quality is very good . Battery after 100% stays for more than a day which is good. But what would u do with battery if phone keeps hanging and software doesn't responds well !!My suggestion is dont go for this phone rather go for A or S series phones.

This is the best phone from Samsung in mid range upto 20k go for it.Camera and battery is just awesome and also performance.The best part of this phone its reverse charging and 6000 mah battery and specially back camera boz its come with Sony imx682 sensor which is awesome and give fantastic photos.I really like back camera and also include its single take feature u can take 5 photos and 3 video including slow motion in a single take.Charging super fast with 25 what fast charger.One more thing really so nice its super amoled display which colors are awesome gives fantastic viewing experience.I am using this phone since 20 days so I am so happy with this and I must say go for it this is the best phone in 20k range with lots of features.One more thing I must say never find phone like this in other brands in this range.

  I will come straight to the point that everything is fine with this phone except the network connectivity and internet connection, comparatively to my previous phone. this phone have a slow internet connectivity  it could have been better, the main role starts when there are places where the network bars are low as compared to other places, if network is very strong then there is no issue with the internet connectivity but if there are one or two network bars then there is a problem with the internet connection. I have experienced with my previous phone that is realme1, even if the network bars are one or two the internet connectivity was never a problem. I really hope this gets fixed soon with an update.

  What a display.. this is my first time try at Amoled and now I am hooked to it. Considering my theory of always spend consciously on phones, Samsung is the only available option to provide such a best display with punchy colours.Let me give you some Pros:1. 6.5"" Super Amoled is my top most fav. feature at this range.2. Clean software with no ads is so much of a relief.3. Knoxx security hardware to keep you tension free of malwares and hacking.4. What a camera man!! Perfect quality photos output and I love it.5. Design is just gorgeous - Shiny back which gives you premium feel in hand and side fingerprint sensor is perfect for my medium hands.Cons:Only 1 - Processor is made for normal people like me who uses phone for a phone and sometimes as a business handheld device (Not a gaming device)Also.. added feature by Samsung is One UI features and additional apps like free VPN and others

But there are some pros and cons.The camera quality is very very good, but the 6000mah battery is dissapointing takes about 1hour to charge and gives 1-1.5 days battery life depending upon the use.The phone is a little heavy due to the hudge battery, but the battery performance is not up to the mark.The processor is also good but not for pro gaming.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Ordered on The Great Indian Sale 8th Oct 12 AM. Received the phone on  23 OctAll aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 1 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

    Almost a flagship like experience with M31s at a mid range price point.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have been a samsung user for like 7 years now. Currently I'm using S10+ and I have gifted M31s to my sister. Using M31s is almost a flagship phone with just one area to improve. Overall M31s is best in class phone for the price range.Likes: 1. Beautiful display like any Samsung flagship device, 2. Huge battery 🔋 that lasts for more than a day with mid to heavy usage/screen on time, 3. Quad Camera setup is one of the best in class for this price range, 4. Fingerprint unlock works like a pro and is very comfortable to use, 5. 6GB memory and 128 GB of storage variant is sufficient for most of the users.Areas to Improve: 1. Exynos 9611 processor is capable enough to handle the operations in the phone but as compared to M31s flagship like features, this processor looks little weak. There is no lag or reduction in performance for daily use tasks. Samsung's One UI integrates with the hardware exceptionally well. Can play most of the games smoothly but a heavy gamer would not be satisfied with this processor. Any upper version of exynos or snapdragon would be a great fit for this device. 2. Build quality doesn't feel cheap but not great either. Glass or aluminum body would be a great fit for this device. Anyhow, we have put spigen case on this device and it feels premium with super amoled display in front.Overall, we are happy to get M31s. Would surely recommend this device as the best branded mid range device at this price point.

  I didn't Purchase Samsung Devices Before for myself because of high price but believe me this pH is a game changer for budget segment.After using it for more then 15 days, I am writing this review.Display 5/5 (Best Display u can get under this price segment)Camera 5/5 (This time Samsung use Song sensor and it's really one of the highlight of this phone)Battery 5/5 (6000MAh what can u expect with 25w fast charger which will easily last 1.5 days with heavy use)Performance 4.5/5 (Practically I am not a mobile gamer but still for testing purposes I played all the games like COD, PUBG,Asphalt 9,Coc and genuinely the optimization of this processor is way better then I expected, it will give u no lag I can promise u that)Built Quality 4.5/5 (I gave 0.5 rating just because this pH is little bit bulky but build quality is great though)Sound 4/5 (The speaker out is very loud and decently clear but when it's comes to headphone performance it's best coz of Dolby with adaptive sound, if u are a music lover u will love it)Software 5/5 (One of the best is out there on the market for Android, when u start using this pH with ONE Hi, u will started to feel how well optimized and featured pack this is is which will definitely make Ur day to day task much for simple)**In simple words don't go with rumours, this pH is very well balanced.

    Best option if looking for Non Chinese Brand, under 20 K and trusted Brand
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Writing this review after 15 days of usage. Battery is excellent. I charge once in 2 days. It also comes with reverse charging so you can also share Battery with someone in urgent need thanks to 6000 mAh battery. Camera is good. Single Take feature of Camera is very good when you actually use it you can know its benefit. Display is very good. I loved the side fingerprint unlock feature. Its very fast and accurate. You can add upto 3 fingers for unlocking. Only drawback is that you need to keep additional phonelock option like pattern otmr PIN for fingerprint lock. It cannot be kept standalone option for phone unlock. Phone back side design is good but after all its plastic only. Would have loved if metal or corning gorolla glass given on back side. Finger marks are clearly seen on back side. Go for a cover immediately as the camera is slightly above back panel so cover will protect the camera when you keep the phone in any flat surface or pocket. Dual sim slot and separate slot for memory card is useful which i was missing in my earlier device MI. Hands-free port also available which is missing in one plus nord. I have reduced one star only for reason Snapdragon processor not available in this handset and back side could have been more premium which you will find in many competitors in same price segment. If you want under 20K and trusted brand and avoid Chinese phone than this is the Best option.

    The best mobile for Camera, Battery and AMOLED DISPLAY
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Who want to buy a mobile for Camera, Battery and AMOLED DISPLAY, Samsung galaxy m31s is the best under 20kI like this mobile for DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.Actually my dislike for Mobile cover is missing..  if mobile cover also added it will be the best. But now also best but I prefer to transparent mobile cover is needed.

  Pros.1. Fabulous display. From its full hd+ super amoled display, video playback is a treat. High contrast , crisp and vibrant colours. The best display for the price range.2. Excellent battery life. With 6000mah battery it easily last for a day of heavy usage. Provided with a 25W fast charger which takes almost 2 hrs for fully charging.3. The side mounted fingerprints scanner is pretty fast and placed accurately.4. Comes with a hybrid sim tray which is a very handy feature.5. Comes with android 10 with One UI 2.0 which I like personally.6. The bezels are thin the front facing camera is provided on a small hole punch design.Cons.1. Performance.  It comes with an exynos 9611 processor which is an older on. I experience some UI lag. Installing and uninstalling apps takes a longer time.2. It comes with bloatwares, some bloatwares can be removed but some cannot be removed.3. It comes with a 60hz display. Should gave been excellent if Samsung provides with a 90hz one.4. The camera seems decent.Comes with a sony imx 682 sensor 64mp primary camera,12mp ultra wide, 5macro,5 depth.The overall picture quality is decent but they should have given a option to take raw pictures.I am unsatisfied with the slow motion videos. The frames seems missing and I am not getting a smooth video.

  I am writing this review after 2 months of usage.I bought it for my husband. It was extremely hard to convince to switch to Samsung because of past reviews that Samsung mobile heat up and hang a lot.Though initially he was not convinced as m31s is having Exynos 9611 processor. As seen online reviews that this is very old processor. But for normal usage on daily basis he didn't find any issue.1) Battery performance is great. Only problem is with my device is that company is claiming that mobile charge 0 to 100 in 97 min. But this device takes upto 180 min. I don't know what is the problem with my phone. Battery lasting for 2-3 days for normal usage.2) For Camera, pictures are getting more sharp and color saturation of picture is vibrant. I have used and I am using Samsung only and only thing I like about is it's picture colors. But Sony sensor makes more vibrant and sharp. My husband likes it. But I like more of a natural color pictures.3) The main plus point of Samsung is OLED Display. Extraordinarily colors. We love it.4) Glastic back body panel is extremely wonderful. I don't have any issue that there is not glass back. It looks premium.

So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment

    Charging port malfunctions within one month of purchase

  Not even a month of purchase, and suddenly one fine morning the dear Mr Samsung M31s decide that I will not identify the charging port, and stops charging, first loses fast charging and then even the cable charging. The only way now to charge is to switch off this phone and charge via cable connected to laptop. And there too takes full night to charge. I have tried, factory reset, cleaned the brand new already blemishless port site, used another cable, exhausted the developer options. Visited Samsung mobile service centre. The lady there has ordered the replacement part. I am hopeful that the phone regains its charging glory and does not throw up any more surprises. Otherwise its a damn good phone with good battery life and low light photography.

    Monster Killer Smartphone Under Segment Rs 20K ( Made In India Smartphone)
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Superb Smartphone From House Of Samsung.....( Made In India Smartphone )It's Really Worthy Smartphone Under Segment Of Rs 20k.I Was Given 10 Highlted Best Features Of M31s ...1) DisplayExcellent 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED infinity - O Display With Cristal Clear Clearity with Bezel Less Design2) Camera I am glad that Samsung has made an effort to improve the camera quality on the Galaxy M31s. On the back of the phone, you will find a 64MP primary Sony IMX682 sensor with an f/1.8 lens. pictures taken with the Galaxy M31s are fantastic. In daylight, all shots looked detailed and punchy.On the front, you’ll find a 32MP wide-angle lens. The front camera is great for taking selfies and video calls. Video capture quality is good, too, on the Galaxy M31s.3) Proceser Samsung has installed its Exynos 9611 chipset inside the Galaxy M31s (the same processor currently found in its Galaxy M31). Performance is on the Decent side, surprisingly. I think 6GB RAM and 128GB storage come in handy when running games.4) Battery / Power Bankthe battery of the Galaxy M31s is easily the best feature of the handset. It comes backed by a 6000mAh battery, which needless to say is huge for a smartphone in this budget.5) CharingThe handset offers support for 25W fast charging and even comes bundled with a 25W charger that obviously comes in handy to charge the enormous battery on the Galaxy M31s.One additional feature on the handset is reverse charging making the smartphone act as a power bank in need.6) Other Features Like USB port , 3.5 mm Jack At the bottom, the device houses a Type-C USB charging port, primary microphone and speaker, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack with Dolby Atmos Support7)  FingerPrint Sensor & Side ButtonOn the right side, the smartphone houses volume rockers and power button with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which works very fast and the left side hosts a dual-SIM slot.8) SoftwareIn terms of software, the Samsung Galaxy M31s runs One UI 2.1 based on Android 10 operating system.Being a custom UI, the Galaxy M31s comes with additional features such as theme support, Dual Messenger that lets you run two versions of supported apps, Device care that optimises the handset in terms of battery, storage, memory and more. The handset comes preinstalled with third party apps that can be uninstalled.9) User Experience Basic tasks like playing games, watching videos, switching between apps, using multiple social media applications were smooth. While playing games like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9, the phone didn’t lag and the graphics were good10) Built & Designone of the best looking M-series smartphones. you will get a super solid build in a unibody design form factor with the Galaxy M31s. The handset feels premium and has a glossy gradient finish back panel. Both colour options — Mirage Black and Mirage BlueDon't Compare It To Another Chinese Smartphone Brand,After All Sales & Service Is also matter , if you Spend Rs 19,499/-& Samsung Is Biggest Brand & Far Better In Services...

  So it has been 8 years back when I bought my first phone of samsung. Now I bought samsung m31s after 8 years. The phone fingerprint and face unlock is very bad i mean I can't believe that samsung brand will do it with their customers i mean we are paying a lot for this. I am disappointed with fingerprint sensor as well as face unlock and I hope samsung will improve these features in next update. Battery life is good. Processor is slow. I am happy with camera.

  I received my Samsung M31s on 19th August. I bought the 8GB Mirage blue, loved the packaging and the chic metallic colour. I bought the same product for another family member as well.The product is very satisfactory with an amazing battery life, only after an entire day of usage does it need to be charged. The fast charge charger is highly beneficial.For the given price the product provides excellent features. The camera helps capture superior quality pictures and videos.One of the biggest advantages about using this mobile is that it allows us to use 2 sims along with an SD card at the same time, most mobiles today do not provide this feature.The display quality is amazing and the touch sensor is very effective. The finger print sensor is to the side which makes it very easy and handy to use.The mobile also has an amazing sound quality. This product is perfect for all age groups, especially college going students.One disadvantage according to me was the lack of the screen recording option which most mobiles have today.Three of my family members are using this product and they all seem to love it. This smart phone has given proper competition to the recently released one plus nord.

  I have been using this device for 10 days and here is my review:Pros:- Great screen: The super AMOLED screen is great. Colours are bright and sharp even when viewing from an angle.- Nice Camera: The camera is great for day light outdoor and in door photography. Although at low light the quality is not that good. Macro lens is also ok.- Battery life: The battery easily last for 28-30 hours. I am a moderate user.- Speaker: Speaker is loud and audio quality is also goodCons:- Charging Time: Although it says faster charger, the charging time is 90-100 mins (From 20% to 100%).- Fingerprint Sensor: The sensor is small and sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone.- No Led notification light.Some minor issues:- Sometimes it takes a bit longer to open app from notification panel.- The screen does not wake when there is a notification from any third party app. It only wakes up for SMS app.- No in built app for tracking daily data usage and warning. It only has monthly data tracking option.- No back cover and screen protector in the box.Overall it is good phone for normal day to day use not for gamers though.

  Namskar,This is my first Samsung Phone and I can tell you for sure that I'm happy to buy it.Let's talk about features of this phone-: Fingerprint reader works fantastic but sometimes it makes me confused as it is a power button too. Overall I liked it because it's very easy to unlock the phone.: Battery life is super awesome. I generally keep data and screen turn on all the time and it lasts almost 14-16 hours. Fast charging is also a plus point for this phone. If you're looking a phone with proper battery life then definitely you can go for it. Also Reverse charging is useful feature. I don't play games so I'm not able to tell you gaming experience with its battery.: Camera is just fantastic as it has a 64MP Quad Camera. Ultra wide makes it super cool. Clarity and details are also satisfactory. If you can use single take properly then it's also a good feature available with this phone.: Design is just mind blowing. Gradient at its back gives rich look to the phone.Overall I like the phone though there is a problem in facial recognition and price range could have been 18k-20k for 8GB 128GB.Kindly check other's reviews also and then make a decision.

  I have received this 6gb 128gb variant in 6 days on normal delivery. Starting with the monstrous battery, I booted my device on 54% and with continuous use of 6 hours, it's battery drain to 23% only. After 109 minutes of full charge on next day, I used it for 3 hours of continuous online lectures. Then surfed on social media, made calls, tested camera in detail(no gaming). With this usage at the end of the day, it was remained with 31%. It's battery life is THE BEST. Coming to the camera, this is really INTELLI CAM. 64 MP quad camera setup is stunning. 64 MP camera doesn't support scene optimizer, but images are quite sharp(not eye pleasing, original only). But the 16 MP lens is also very good, supporting scene optimizer  which enhances the image according to the surrounding and the output is very eye catchy. It's 123° wide angle lens is superb, with enough details. Depth sensing and macro camera are pretty good. Single take feature is very interesting. Video stabilization is far better. Slow motion and hyperlapse modes are the best. Selfies are sharp and best. Overall it's a best camera phone. Fingerprint sensor is fast enough. I didn't notice any lag till now. This is the best device under 20k.

  While writing reviews I want to give only few points to you to consider.1. Sony cameras comes with a perfect quality photoshoot. In this budget the camera quality really surprises me.2. Quad cameras fulfilling all my camera needs. Special mention of low light performances.3. Selfie camera quality is best I used so far.4. 8 gb ram, it is sufficiently handling all my work from home and gaming needs in one machine without hanging a single time.5. 128 gb memory. So no need to use a SD card but still no need to delete stuffs.6. High performance  battery.  Does not drain quickly. Even if drains so big battery charges lightning fast with 25W charger. Even works as power bank.7. Screen size and quality no questions.All this within 25k but from a brand named Samsung, not any cheap brand.  What extra you need at this cost?

  To be very honest... I'm using this phone from since 1 week and I really liked it...I was looking to to buy a phone since 2 months and I selected two phones 1. One plus Nord.  2.Samsung galaxy M31s .....in the end I decided to go with this one as the price of Nord is bit high with descent specs... Now if I talk about the Pros of this phone1. Great display (s AMOLED infinity-o-display)2. Huge battery ( screen on time is 9h 30min approx continuously used like gaming( 1 hour ), browsing, music, videos, etc...)3. Fast side fingerprint scanner4. Camera ( I'm in love with it, I loved the 'single take' and 'shot suggestion' features)5. Reverse charging ( you can use it as a power bank)6. UI ( I love the samsung's 'One UI' nd One plus's 'Oxygen OS' )7. Dark mode ( Awesome)If I talk about the cons...1. Processor ( Samsung should think about this....still using the old one....not bad for daily usage...but not recommendable for game lovers)2 A little bit of heating on heavy usage.3. Should provide a glass back although back side is of glastic which look descent.Overall I really liked this phone and a good to go phone ....so I definitely recommend this one.

  Mid ranger phone with excellent specs. I was certain on buying One Plus Nord but the specs of the phones and critically comparing them strictly under cost benefit, Samsung M31S was a real winner. A specific mention on the Camera, Battery life and built quality which is nothing short of a premium. Faster than Snapdragon 765G, Exynos 9611 really makes the experience super smooth. The only drawback is that it doesn't support 5G which is gonna be the thing of the future. But that's gonna be a while.If u are just looking for a good budget phone in 20K segment, go for this. A Special shoutout to Amazon for timely and quality delivery even under such adverse conditions.. 👍

  Iam a samsung m20 user before buying m31s phone. So I think I can clearly explain you guys all the upgradation in m31s . I have no issues with the phone so far ! Its an amazing phone within the budget. Camera, display, battery, fingerprint reader are doing exceptionally well. I just give a honest review based on the usage of my phone. You guys can check out the photos I click using m31s on my Instagram page - abhikiran66FINGERPRINT :The only flaw I found in fingerprint reader is that due to new position of this finger print reader, unknowingly finger gets placed on the sensor by me or people using my phone and It gets blocked for 60 seconds and coming to face detection for unlocking the phone it isn't working properly, infact it isn't working at all in my phone compared to Samsung m20.BATTERY:I have no complaint against battery. Its  6000mh battery. My phone ran for 2 days continously with one charging.I love the new idea of type c to type c charger.Phone is getting charged really fast.  The onky flaw I experienced is I cannot connect my phone with the charger. I had to buy a new type c cable.CAMERA:when it comes to the camera, I just loved it. As a photographer I really like camera features they are offering in this budget. I'm gonna add some pictures which I clicked from the phone

  The overall experience is good. There is some bloatware but there is an option to uninstall almost all of them unlike those chinese phones. Giving you a clean software experience.Camera: really good, natural colours. Can take really good photos using the manual mode.Battery: not as expected as in a 6000mah one but still pretty good than other phones.Fingerprint reader: there is no vibration feedback while using it so it maoes it difficult to use it. Not as good as the conventional dedicated ones on the back like other phones.Display is excellentEven though its made of plastic, it feels premium on the hands and doesnt look cheap unlike the m21 series. The phone is a fingerprint magnet, and since its made of plastic and since its a little heavy, it needs a hard case.The main drawback is the processor, which is an outdated one. You feel it struggling during gaming or any stuff like that. But during normal usage like instagram, snapchat, facebook and whatsapp, there arent any issues at all and its a lag free experience.If you can spend some more money, and you do a lot of heavy tasks i would suggest the galaxy M51 which comes with a very good snapdragon 730g processor.But if its just for normal calls, and social media and stuff. This a really good choice.

  The Galaxy M31s performs well in almost every aspect. There are some minor issues with the smartphone which does not necessarily affect the overall performance. The M31s delivers as promised, and you can definitely consider it if you are looking for a good mid-range phone. It is important to note that there are competitors which offer the same package but at a lower price.Battery : This is its 6,000mAh battery which lasted for around 20 hours straight. This is in normal usage but with a few moments of light gaming and streaming as well. The giant battery, however, takes very long to charge even with 25W fast charging speed.Display : The front of the Samsung Galaxy M31s is also occupied by the 6.5″ FHD+ Super AMOLED display, which is very good. Samsung’s AMOLEDs are some of the best in the market, and the Galaxy M31s is in the same boatFingerprint sensor : Samsung Galaxy M31s does not have a rear fingerprint sensor, as the sensor has been moved to the side which doubles as the power button. Samsung could have chosen to go with an in-display fingerprint sensor, but the speed and reliability are as good as a conventional rear fingerprint sensor, so I have no complaints. The placement is also good, though users with smaller hands might appreciate it being placed lower. All the buttons also click well.

  Best phone for me.. camera quality superb you need to select 64mp potrait or 32mp selfie.. slow-mo,super slow-mo everything is perfect just need proper lighting condition. Indoor there is noise while using slow-mo. Night mode is awesome..bit noisy but main subject looks perfect. Wide angle camera good not best.. but its ok for me. Single  take is awesome. Different pictures videos with music.Battery life is really good. I have been using since yesterday. Till now its 65%. As usual you can use power optimised mode. Turn off auto sync mode and dynamic wallpapers to prevent battery draining. Depends on what you are using.Used camera for long, played games like candy crush, infinite differences, infinite word search and so on. Heating issue observed while using camera but tolerable. And temperature falls down on its own after closing camera and doing something else.Video calling quality very nice no interruption.Not a heavy user but more than average.Fast charging is good.Looks wise its premium. Doesn't matter to me whether plastic glastic or glass.Definitely this phone is not best for heavy gamers but it won't  disappoint for more than average user.Initially i feared reading others review for missing charger, dead phone. But fortunately i got good one.

  I would like to start with the cons as the major problem that I am facing is still not resolved even after software update.Cons:1. Nearly 40% of the time the other person are unable to call you.For the other person the phone is ringing whereas Samsung m31s doesn't even ring or show any missed call.This is a major problem and the company should test out their product before launching them.2. The 25W charger is small compared to 6000MAH battery. I agree the battery is big but the time taken to charge is 2 hours which is same for a non fast charging phone.3. Finger print is not that quick.4. Face unlock doesn't work most of the time.5. None of these issue is fixed in the software update.Pros:1. Camera is good.2. Battery life is good.3. Look and feel of the phone.

  Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Super Fast charging and 25W charger top with phone. The phone came with 95% charge. Quick Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good with doblly atoms.- Camera is really good 64Mp sony senor,12Mp wide angle 8mmmMacro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received second day by 10 AM !

  So recently got my hands on the all new Samsung Galaxy M31s (8GB/128GB). This phone is literally a beast. Lets start from it’s display, you’ll be getting the sAmoled which every Samsung user has been loving it right from the beginning. It’ll be coming with the Exynos 9611 and it’s quad camera setup is just phenomenal. The 64MP primary camera along with 12MP wide angle camera and 5MP depth and macro makes it a good buy. The Selfie camera is a 32MP camera which will bring a big smile on your face. It has got a colour gradient back. The one i have is the Mirage Blue variant which is truly a thing to be loved. It has got a single take feature which will be giving you multiple outputs like fliter, crop, hyperlapse, boomerang and much more! You will be recieveing a 25W fast charger that would charge your phone within some minutes. So finally i will be quoting the last feature, that is it’s reverse charging feature which would enable you to charge a second phone using everyone’s favourite Samsung Galaxy M31s.I guess would be wrong to say that it might be your next phone. It should be “IT MUST BE YOUR NEXT PHONE”.

    Samsung m31s - A massive disappointment
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It has been just over a week since I started using the Samsung m31s, shifting from Oppo F11 which I was using earlier. Given here is a summary based on my usage:1. Camera is good. It has a few good additions to it. The quality of images is nice. However, not radically better than my previous phone.2. On paper, specifications are good. Biometric scans are good addition, however many times login issues are being encountered by me, so I feel it needs technical improvements.3. The phone has a good design and is generally eye catching. The transfer of data proved to be smooth with Samsung Switch.4. Usage wise got bored of it within a day. Nothing very exciting or new in usage experience.5. Noticeable lags and slowness encountered even with basic usage, no game scenario.6. Biggest drawback is battery. The charger takes an eternity to charge, and seems to be lagging ages behind in technology as compared to Oppo, One Plus, etc. Just for this point, I am not too happy with my purchase.7. However, it is not Chinese. But I feel based on my usage that other options may be explored.

  Camera quality is good and has a variety of options. From 48 mp shots, slow mo, super slow mo, hyperlapse, to selfie camera, everything is good. They surely should improvise in night mode😐. Battery life is the most kickass I've ever seen. And the quich charge is just cherry on top. It would never bother u to charge your phone. And most of man, this boy has got a super amoled infiniti o display which supports hdr 10 too. Samsung never disappoints us with their displays. A power budget phone, if your in search for something with great screen, great battery life and camera👌👌

  Reviewing after 1 Month's timePros:1. Samsung's Quality Display2. Good Battery life. With Medium usage, it lasts upto full 2 days time.3. Fast Battery charger. 20% to 100% takes around 1.5 hours time which is Ok.4. Camera Quality is very good5. There is no Lag when doing Multitasking with Phone.Cons:1. Fingerprint scanner. It uses the same Power Button which results in Poor detection especially when Mobile is using Back cover. This issue is not there in Samsung M31 model where Fingerprint scan is at the Rear side of Phone. Not sure why they changed it in the Latest M31S model.2. Lot of unwanted Default Apps comes Pre-loaded which is not allowed to uninstall. Can only disable it

  The best phone under the budget phone segment in terms of display ,camera and battery . The performance of the phone is average since it has Exynos processor ,which is good processor if you are not gaming alot. the battery backup is ULTIMATE , it last for more than 20 hours of continues usage and even it charging is faster ,all thanks to 25W fast charger. The camera performance is ultimate , the picture quality is very good . but the only flaws i have noticed in terms of video is that it doesn't has 60 fps recording.The biggest advantage is that it has work mode were you can secure your important work related files ,contacts ,photos ,etc & it is SECURED BY KNOX.BUT OVERALL IT'S  ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCT INTRODUCED BY SAMSUNG.

  This is the best smartphone if you are looking for great camera, display and battery life. It's camera are way better than any 25000 to 27000 smartphone.Most important part for my mobile is camera and display.But it's processor is weaker than the Snapdragon. If you want to play game in mobile then prefer Snapdragon processor but with that you will be compromising with camera and display.The only bad thing about this is that their is a lag sometimes while opening app but you can get rid of this by disabling animation of opening app. Other than it I find this mobile amazing, superb, marvelous.Talking about its battery and charging speed. It charged 96% from 50% in just 20-30 min. My battery has never been gone down less than 50% only on heavy usage it reached 50%. Normally usage it lie around 75%-86% in a day.

  This is my 3rd Samsung device i have been using.The best and highlight thing for this phone is its Super AMOLED Display.Even if the phone back is not GLASS the Glastic feature used in this used helps to look classic and helped to reduce the weight of the phone.It comes with EXYNOS 9611 which good for daily use and 3.5/5 for Gaming.The Rear Quad camera setup looks premium and works as PERFECT.The Single punch Hole camera in the front helps me to Have BEST Viewing experince.The Battery Performace is SUPER PERFECT WHICH Comes with 6000 MAH BATTERY.EVEN if the charger comes with 25W the TYPE C - TYPE C comes more effecient than other USB - A TO TYPE C CHARGERS.THE ONE UI Which comes with Samsung Is one of my favorite. Even though there are Some BLOTWARES i Can assure that all apps that come can be UNINSTALLED. I can GIVE 4.5/5 FOR THIS PHONE

  Samsung galaxy m31s is most anticipated mobile ever because of its unique mixture of A and M series mobile features. It's the 1st mobile in M series to provide many flagship features like single take, 25w fast charging, infinity O display and even it is secured by knox.Pros:1.Big battery and it's quite good with 1 and half day use. A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.

  First of all, I like Samsung brand. I was much waited for the M31S and finally decided to purchase.Everything is good. The most which is didn't like is ....1. Battery- It takes almost 3+ hours to fully charge. Once fully charge it only last for 24 hours. 1st day, played only pubg got heat up. Then slowly watch movies on netfix prime videoEven if you use the phone for normal purpose the battery will drain within 24 hours or may extend for few hours.2. Fingerprint - little slow3. Should have change the processor. its too oldPurchase on release date. Product comes with dust on it. No cover, no invoice, even manual was also not included.**OVERALL I SAY WHAT IS MEANT FOR FAST CHARGING**

  Have been using this phone for few months now. No issues so far. Exchanged my Huwawei honor 8x to get this just to avoid using a Chinese phone. The first thing I had to do was spend time removing the preinstalled apps in the phone. Needless irritation. Earphone and plastic cover was not included with phone. Backside is plasticy. Camera is nice. No heating issues. All android phones look and feel the almost the same so there is nothing to get excited about them. Battery was better than hawai 8x . Huwai8x had a better glass back. Samsung should ship phones with stock android. Samsung , I don't want to give my usage data to you. One google is enough to spy on us.

The combunation of 6000 mah battery and 25 watt charger us wow and cannot be seen any where. On moderate use this snartphone can hild upto 24-26 hrs and in extreme use the battry can last upto 16-18 hrs which is again great.This smartphone has 6.5 inches SUPER AMOLED + infinity o display which guves vivid colors which looks colorful and gives amazing emersive viewing experiance.Now, the most controversual part is its processor. This smartphone has Exynos 9611 processor which is alright in daily and moderate use. If you are extreme user then this smartphone can show little lag.This snartohobe has 32 MP front camera which is infinity o punch hole in the center. The rear camera has 64MP quad rear camera with a 64 MP sony IMX sensor in it.Overall at the price of under 20,000 this smartphone is best of all nad can be used very nicely.

   This particular smartphone is actually a COMPLETE PACKAGE. You get everything you could ask for. Two main highlights - 6000 mah🔋 and 64 MP 📷. This two specifications are literally a game changer.Being a Photographer, I get so much benefits of these two specs. Also, one can't forget about front camera with wide angle option. The AI automatically detects if more people are in the frame and switches normal camera mode to a wide angle mode! The 4K video with Super Steady Mode is LEGIT!The Live Focus mode is Amazing for portraits and product photography.Along with that, you get side fingerprint sensor and a quick access to notification panel with the sensor.We all know how great Samsung Display is. They didn't hesitate to show their display quality here also!The 6/8 GB ram with 128GB storage is a Life Saver.For me personally, its the best smartphone available in the market in this particular price range. (Considering Company Origin)Definitely consider Samsung M31s!

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.Fingerprint sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good.However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box.M31s is actually better than A51 and its screen to body ratio is 91% and A51 is having 87.44% image resolution is  9000x7000 pixels.It has better specs than A51 which retails around 7-8k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Till then book your phone

  I have been using OnNext for close to 4 years and I am very happy with Samsung and thus decided to go with Samsung yet again and I must say .... never been dissapointed yet.Here are a few points I like about the phoneBattery: the battery 🔋 is good, gives me 48hours on a full charge. (My last phone started off with 48 hours but still gives me 24 hours) I guess the 48 hours will narrow down to 24 gradually but till then, I will use it to the fullest.Camera: I am totally delighted with the camera, sturdy pics, low light images. I am definitely going to need some more storage with more pics being clicked.Storage: I had a 64 gb internal on my last phone and have decided to upgrade to 128 this time. Quiet happy with the extra storage availability.Screen: I like the screen to body ratio awesome placement of front camera in-between the screen. Good usage of space.All in all: Samsung has amazed me for the last 4 years and I am sure it will continue to amaze me going forward as well

And in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682 with an 64MP f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.7.

Exynos 9611 processor is mediocre when compared to Snapdragon chipset family. This processor with 10nm consumes more battery power.SAR value 1.38W/KG is definitely high even though within the limits compared to other M series family. Lastly this phone is not for gamers.Ideally suited for people who are looking for good camera and good battery backup.

  Camera: 5/5 ( amazing camera with perfect edge detection and proper saturation. Comes with the flagship single take feature, which is awesome. Intellicam works really really well, and totally justifies the tag.)Battery: 3.5/5 ( but i am a heavy user )Display: 5/5 (Samsung produces the best mobile displays. Even other phones use these displays.)Built quality: 4.5/5 (0.5 deduced as it is prone to scratches, use a transparent cover if you want the looks of back panel with adequate protection.)Performance: 4/5 ( however some apps may crash sometimes )Fingerprint sensor: 4/5 (is fast enough, considering the price)Some bugs are present. However, considering its a new product, i think most bugs would be resolved with future software updates.If you are not a heavy gamer then this is the perfect choice in the range with perfect looks.it even works pretty well for moderate gaming. Much better than its chinese counterparts in almost every aspect if you are not a heavy gamer. Go for other options, if you want a phone only for gaming.Samsung has done a great job. 👍

  The Screen quality is just awesome. You will not regret if you love to  watch OTT on phone.Camera specially the Portrait Mode (Live Focus) definitely needs improvement. The day light photos comes awesome, but does not support stabilization. Low light photos are just ok.Battery life is awesome (in mild usage). This phone is not for heavy usage as the processor is a bit old.No severe heating issues comes, heat a bit, when watching movies for long hours.Due to large battery, phone is a bit on heavier side. The back is slippery, so if back cover is not used, it may simply slip from your side pocket (and due to heaviness it may damage the screen) , as it did in my case.If you are a mild to medium user, who need good camera, screen and battery go for this, you will never regret.

  I bought samsung galaxy m31s mirage black on 26th of august 2020. In September I had a problem on fingerprint it became slow nd sometimes not working too. Nd slowly the mobile processor became very slow nd now it was not charging the charger was not standardise. Not even a single percent of charging. Phone became dead. Service centre told me to change the charger pin but the charger nd charger pin is not broken it looks completely good nd even then they told me to change charger pin nd whole charger chip, it cost 3,500rs but having warranty it was available for free service now think so because the person in that centre haven't told me properly so I wanted to raise a complaint issue on my order but it was not available . So i doesn't know what should I do now. Seriously I was very disappointed with this product. The mobile life has not even came for 2months. Not valuable for money. I have wasted by buying mobile on online. I doesn't know whom should I blame for either amazon or Samsung company!

  Best money worth mobile phone in this prize range.  Go for it without any doubt. This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm very glad for i ordered this phone in launched date. Now I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good:1- Android 10!Awesome  looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now! I can enjoy with all features of android 10!2 - Super AMOLED display is extra excellent. The eye cooling Blue light filter support is great. 3- Performance is very good. No notable issues. ( I'am a well gamer. I had a little anxiety in this processor in overnloading problems when i gaming continues. But now I confirmed that no issues from this possessor )4- 6000 mAh battery is too BIG! I can use my phone as a power bank also. Reverse charging supporting feature helps us also  in emergency situations.5- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot6- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE7- Fast charging specification and awesome 25W fast charger top with phone. ( When I measured the charging time i got it takes 50 seconds to charge 1 percent. Then the phone will be take only 97 minuts to charging from 0% into  100%!.8- Mobile speakers sound is like stereo, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.9- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good look at skin in tatoo photo and dust particles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31s are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support HD video 3840x2160, I may not requireto carry my DSLR everywhere.10- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is very good11- Free from banned, annoying apps and ads. I ready enjoy a different usage from other chinese phones.Not So Good:1- Not that thin, but ok. I'm satisfied2- Doesn't have Samsung Dex3- Started to Boot Screen! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then everything was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth.4- I was expected a phone case and screen guard in phone box. But i didn't get.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use it is a powerhouse and you feel it - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.Good phone.

  This awesome smartphone is the best among other Chinese smarphones available in the market. This budget segment phone by Brand like Samsung is surely a gift for India, however, I am not happy with the samsung age old exynos processor, they must come up with snapdragon processor in order to beat the competition. Samsung should launch snapdragon processor at this price range, it will surely attract more buyers. Now, talking about the camera then let me say its almost giving competition to the beginner DSLR cameras. Video quality looks fabulous, I have shared few snapshots for better clarification. However I have felt battery draining issue in this phone. Despite being 6000mah it hardly lasts for 1 day if you use net and YouTube. But after all atleast this Samsung set is not hanging yet or else this is the age old problem of samsung devices that they hang. To sum up, face unlock, fingerprint and cameras are superb and 128gb of storage is way sufficient enough for your works so go for it.

  This is my first Samsung phone. I am really impressed with the specs Samsung has provided in this price. I love this color combination and expect Samsung to explore more like this.Camera gives a wonderful picture quality,  even though if I am not using 64 MP. Night mode is one of the major highlights.Had heard alot about Samsung's display, and eventually after using it, I found it quite awesome.I've been using this phone for more than 2 weeks, and haven't faced any lagging issues.Battery too goes well, but degrades a bit faster with heavy usage.Overall I would rate this phone 5 out of 5. I'm glad I switched to Samsung.

No matter how heavy user you are. It will long last atleast a full day. For me it is 1.5 days.Screen quality is better than my iphone 7. Thanks to SAMOLED.Camera quality is again better than iphone 7. Thanks to 4 cameras.Processor is mediocre. Nothing great to boast about it.

  Hii Friends..The Fingerprint (side mounted) is really awesome... I am using it from app. 1 week and I really liked it... But as we know nothing is perfect the camera quality can be improved a little bit.. the battery is too good not according to specs but i really find it very very awesome.. The proccessor is little bit old is also using in other M series line up.. But it doesn't matter at all for a normal user or even good for games like free fire, COD,ext. The best thing I am loving is the Single take option in default Camera...Seriously, It is outstanding...At last we can say it pay for value... Display is really a good attracting object...for a mid range phone user it is like more than own eyes.. I will rate it 4.8/5 seriously...Knox security is also make it more valueable...

  Please avoid  buying this.1. Battery draining problem.  Though this has 6000mAh battery but is doesn't last for even 10 hours of moderate use. Using Microsoft Team app it drain within 7 hours. May be defective product delivered by Amazon.2. Processor is very slow.3. Heating problem.4. Face unlock doesn't work well. Sometimes is doesn't recognizes. And if it recognizes it takes long time.5. Camera is best within 200006. Though it has 25W charger but it takes 2.5 hours for full charge when when mobile is switched on and 2 hours when switched off.7. Flight mode tile doesn't work in single click.8. Screen is best under 20000. But it lacks protection. Even when you are sitting and it slips off your pocket it develops crack.9. TPU and Screen protector is must.10. Replacement service is not good.  Amazon can deliver at your location but may not arrange pickup at that location.

  The screen is gorgeous! If you have never seen one before, you will fall in love with it! I was confused between MOTO ONE FUSION PLUS and M31s, but let me tell you, the gorgeous SUPER AMOLED Screen is enough to counter MOTO with LCD display, Camera are working great but i will add more review after I have used it enough, same with battery cant say enough but as of now, it has given me 5hrs screen time for 50% discharge. Speakers are loud enough. The phone may look bulky hefty and thick in online youtube reviews but trust me, it is way confortable and sleek than what is looks online! I have not tested PUBG mobile yet but there no lag whatsoever in switching between apps or opening apps. And lastly the amazon delivery is ULTRAAAA fast, I orderded on 19 AUG  11PM and it was delivered to me on 21 AUG 5PM and that too with Cash on delivery Option!  Well this is obviously a first impression review, will come up after some days with full review!

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  To be very honest, the sAMOLED display works wonders.The various power options help with the performance and optimization. For example, if I need my phone to last longer and be able to make/receive calls and check mails and/or whatsapp, I can switch to ultra power saving mode. If you are a gamer, you can just choose the game launcher that dedicates a specific amount of RAM to the application of your choosing. Thus, maximizing the performance.M31S also comes with one of the fastest fingerprint sensor.The camera quality is outstanding but, some improvements are still needed with the scene optimization. But overall, it is good.The only problem is it's usb. You need a type c to type c cable for this or else, the charger will be rendered useless.Overall, it's a perfect fit for someone like me who needs their phone to last all day long (whilst scrolling through several social media sites and feeds the whole day).

  Camera is superb in this range. I am quite amazed by its camera performance. Gaming is absolutely fantastic. No heating or lagging issue I have noticed till now. Battery life is decent. With a single charge I spend whole day with internet connectivity and playing little bit of games in free time. Most important the screen. Wow it's amazing. Samsung is the leader in this area. So, as expected the colour and the brightness is very nice.I think samsung concentrated on these 3 major functionalities and they are bang on their target.

  Hello Readers,I will divide my views about phone in pros and cons.Pros :-1. Camera - Quality of pictures and videos is upto the mark. You should be skilled enough to utilize it.2. Battery - For average user battery will last for more than 24 hours.3. Display - Touch and feel of the using premium display provided in this model is excellent.4. Charger - Charge is good and delivers fast charging.5. RAM - I didn't face heating issues or lags as I didn't use phone for gaming. Not sure about performance if high end games are played.Cons:-1. Fingerprint reader - It is comfortable to use but sometimes don't read and have to keep figure multiple times.2. Graphics - Online images flikker if there is lot of animation.3. Connectivity - It looses connection with certain devices like fire stick several times.Overall - With better processor and graphics enhancer Samsung can be best in market. I guess M51 will be the best option to buy in its price range in near future i.e. by 10th Sep 2020. Hope this review helps you to take your decision.

Selfie cam is nice! Battery backup is awesome! With continuous 4G use and daily 2-3 hours of Video streaming and other phone use battery lasts for two days for me! Only cons I feel is Processor doesn't do justice to 8 Gb ram..Overall a great device.!

  I would say the performance is average. I found couple of issues.WiFi 5Ghz is not working properly. The download speed I am getting with 5Ghz is less than normal 2.4 GHz. I complained with Samsung support but no use. No issues with my other devices which supports WiFi GHz, so the problem is with Samsung galaxy M31s.Battery life is ok but not two days like some of the reviews mentioned. One day it will last without any problem.Speaker sound is just adequate. I am having Oppo F 11 which is having better sound quality.Finger print unlock works fast. One issue with side finger sensor is that using your left hand fingers is difficult compared to sensors in back.Overall avoidable.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I bought a samsung M31 through amazon. Within a month the display of the phone stopped working. I took the phone to your customer care in Bankura (pin code: 722102) on Saturday 5th Sept but they did not receive the phone saying it was after hours. At that point they saw the phone there was no mark on it. Today When I took the phone again they refused to take the phone as there was a circular spot on the screen (see the picture attached). I never dropped the phone, as there is still no fall visible dent on the phone. The mark on the screen came naturally within the phone. But now the service center is refusing to accept the phone. Maybe they already knew this mark would come in time and that's why didn't accept the phone on the first dayThis is horrible customer service from a brand like samsung. I paid 20000/- for my phone and this is what I get? Hope you can take necessary action to replace my phone at the earliest. I am very sorry I had the misfortune to buy your horrible product, never again. I have always had good experience with moto and I should have stuck with it.

  The phone is just superb..The camera quality is top notch(even better than Apple(seriously)).Dolby Atmos support so best sound when connected with headphones. The storage capacity is good. 6 GB RAM..means it doesn't stutter while multitasking..I checked with Asphalt 9, Call of Duty mobile works wonderful & the battery is so so good..The phone gets full in 1 and half hour. And I played Call of duty battle royale till the end. And only 3% reduced. Fingerprint sensor is side mounted. So, there is a little bit problem that whenever you want to just see the lockscreen it unlocks directly or it starts to scan your finger. One issue is that if you are doing something and your screen is timed out, then when you unlock the phone, the app or whatever you are doing will freeze, so, just tap the left side button and then it will resume. The phone is long in length not in breadth so it's quite handy to hold.. And trust me.. Exynos is good, really good. Overall I would say 4 out of 5. 1 less for that freezing thing. But, really nice phone..I am glad I switched to Samsung from other mobile brand.

  Great device. Feels great to k ow that samsung has worked a lot on their software end and pricing. Despite Exnos 9611, the device is performing day to day tasks well. Power management could have been a little for optimised. You get around 7hours of screen on time while pulling through medium usage of productivity apps and a little multimedia. One thing I noticed is that the wide angle camera CANNOT record a video. Although the camera UI is loaded with features as promised. Not knowing about future updates, I really hope that samsung supports the device with timely updates.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  After using the Samsung m31s for a week .I would say that its a terrific purchase!!!All its highlights such as its battery , camera and display deserves appreciation.  Even if u are a heavy user like me one full charge can cover up upto 80% of ur day.And that to fast charging even makes the battery immortal.  sAMOLED is just amazing. U will feel it urself when you will use it.  Camera gives the most natural and crystal clear images it can it has also many other features i have attached some pics also.  And now the processor ...... It uses the Exynos 9611 . Though its a old processor it still performs well for multitasking and gives a  DECENT performance in gaming BUT playing games with high end graphics may cause framedrops or lags .Its back is of glastic design which is vulnerable to scratches so remember to buy a back cover of it as u not be wanting a new phone to take much scratches on the back.And the final thing its a Non Chinese flagshipSo if u are not a hard-core gamer then this is the best choice for you under 20k.

  All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.

  Ahh..Where to start man😕.This mobile is a great deal under 20,000. It can outperform any device in its range. It's a good device for anyone who is into gaming and multitasking.Now lets give you an overall picture about this device!Fingerprint sensor :-This sensor lightning fast and an accuracy of 98% so, no issues regarding fingerprint sensor. It's way better than any other phone in this range.Camera :- This phone has a great camera and samsung has done a great job in optimising the camera software. The dynamic range is good, colour of picture are eye pleasing it will look natural. This camera captures black areas great means picture will look more appealing to your eyes. Front camera is too awesome. If you are planing to buy this device for photoshoot purpose and if you love clicking selfie this phone is for you it will not disappoint you. I have attached some camera samples.Display :- let's just not talk about it everyone knows Samsung makes best display in the world! This phones display looks vibrant and has brightness level of 600 nits means you will have no difficulty using this phone in daylight. Watching movie on this phone has an absolutely great and amazing experience black looks deep which gives display a crisp and clear image. Using this phone in dark mode is love!Software :- One UI 2.1 is good and Samsung has done a great job in optimising it's UI its fast quick and easy to use though the size of the screen is 6.5 i never felt screen is huge thanks to its One UI. UI is smoth you will fall in love with it and will choose any UI over it.Memory :-  6gb RAM is enough for multitasking it will store app longer in memory. It's more than enough.Processor :- Exynos 9611 is a great processor and for gaming it's very good you will never feel frame drops. You will easily be able to play high end games at medium to high settings without an issue. And also this phone gets a up a little warm while playing and litte means very little about 39° celcius.Battery :- it's a monster man! It gives me around 11 hrs of screen time on heavy usage. It will never disappoint you! And charging time is approx 1.30 - 1.50 hours thanks to its super fast charger.Overall this phone is beast you can go for it. But if you want a immense gaming experience then go for M51 if you're a medium users then go for M31s it will not disappoint you at all just go it!

  Order mobile on 24sep2020 it said will be deliver after 2 days but package arrived next day.My budget 20k.Using this mobile for 2 weeks i never used Amoled display mobile before its Great. Image video quality is awesome. I am not a heavy user(moderate user) so I don't need high performance mobile this mobile does the job Great. I choose this mobile bcz using Samsung mobile for years and Samsung phones are great not loaded with unnecessary app like cleaners,power savers which you will find i all Chinese brands and I personally don't like Chinese brands mobile(not bcz of anti China)Samsung one UI is great,fast didn't found any lag in software as off now I seen some YT video which say mobile lag while multitasking. So I am using this mobile for 2 weeks and the battery 🔋last for 2days.It  drains only 50% through out day for Battery I will give 10 on 10. Let's talk about camera it has 4 cam(rear)one main sensor 64mp ,one wide angle,one depth sensor and one macro good image I am a professional in photography but I will say good cameras.Overall I like it little expensive but for Samsung one UI , other features and brand value its a good deal. Yes there are others mobiles comes with high performance(mostly Chinese)at low price. But I made final decisions on Samsung.

  I am writing this review after using Samsung M31s for 20 days. I am very much fan of the M series from Samsung , as they try to bring out a lot of features combined in a budget segment.The overall performance of the mobile is average because it is a mid-ranger mobile. I will highlight some issues which i got while using this mobile:1)There is often a heating issue with the mobile, even with the slightest of use.2) Battery capacity is 6000 mAh though it's not upto the mark. Because battery drains very quickly.3) There is often a problem with sim refreshing , As quite a few times sim goes into a refreshing state.4) Software performance is below average.5) Camera is good. Only main focus is on Single take functionality.6) Samsung should improve the UI interface as when mobile has a heating issue , the multi window tab doesn't operate.7) Samsung needs to improve a lot on UI functionality.8) While using multiple window , there is always a slight lag and heating issue with the mobile.9) I have noticed slight dents while using the phone for long hours.Overall, Samsung M31s is good mid-ranger for normal every day use. I hope with some good future updates Samsung will surely improve UI & processor experience.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I've been using the M31s for over a week now. It is a really good upgraded from my old Samsung A30. The M31s feels very solidly built. And the battery life is just fab.The only issue I had with the Device was the fingerprint reader. It somehow wasn't working properly on day one, it always used to tell me to wipe the reader whenever I tried using my fingerprint. But then I installed an update and the fingerprint reader started working just fine.The camera on this device is very great, I've attached 2 photos. The one with only the helmet was clicked on my friends Samsung Note 10 lite, and the one with a person in the frame was taken by my M31s. And you can very clearly see the difference. All thanks to the advanced Sony sensor which Samsung is offering with M31s. The Note 10 lite also has a Sony sensor but it is an old phone now, although it is still on sale. In some cases the camera on this is even comparable to iPhone XR. Obviously the iPhone has a better colour science but the Samsung has more clarity and details.One drawback on this device is the processor. If you want a faster processor then you can go for the Samsung M51. But for the price, M31s is probably the best smartphone you can buy in a low to mid budget

  It has been over a month now since I have been using this phone. It was delivered to me on 23-08-2020; I'm writing this review on 10-10-2020.First off, I paid 16249INR for the 6gb variant which was possible after I applied for an exchange with Redmi note 4. I consider this - a steal deal.Here's what I have to say -1. Battery backup is excellent, lasts for an entire day with gaming and other operations.2. Camera quality is amazing; it also has a lot of professional modes for capturing great pictures.3. Fingerprint sensor may pose some issues over a period of time. In my case, device displays a message sometimes which reads 'Fingerprint sensor was blocked.....'4. Superb processor, something that Samsung is well known for.Supports shuffling between apps even during live gaming!5. I personally loved the blue light filter and always use the device in that mode. It Serves the purpose for prolonged use.6. Dolby Atmos sound feature works well with equally good quality earphones.7. Game booster is definitely an additional boon for people like me! It reads your battery usage and has a temperature control mechanism. I find it exceptional.I'm Akshay Jamkhedkar. Signing off.Ciao.

  The phone is really good and highly recommend. Most importantly this is a pure made in India phone.  Yes the processor is a bit low but it can easily handle all the powerful games and apps. Samsung  could have upgraded the processor. But according to my use as I don't play games that much, I don't face any problems. But other departments like camera, display,  audio, design, battery are best in class. Fingerprint reader and face recognition is seriously very fast. You can easily get 1 day full battery life with heavy usage and with moderate usage you could get more.. Camera Quality is the best under 20000 be it front and back.This phone is highly recommended.  But yes if you want to buy this phone only for pubg and high end gaming,  think before buying this.

  Overall Samsung M31s is an awesome deal. The camera does not disappoint and captures incredible shots. The single take feature is extremely cool.Now the cons . First is the fingerprint sensor which is not so functional and does not recognize generally. Secondly a more modern processor would have been better like those offered by the competitors.  Third , a plastic case is generally included in almost all other brands and in the A series as well . The standard earphones included in A series models are also missing here.If not for these minor inconveniences this smartphone would have been in my point of view an amazing product.  Still this phone is a great deal and I highly recommend it for those people who enjoy Samsung products like me.

Camera clarity is superior.Eventhough 6000mah,  I felt like the battery is draining fast,  even when kept in power save mode,  may be it will be alright after a software update...I enjoy watching videos and editing photos in my M31s as the refreshment rate feels like more than 60Hz...Above all,  I'm proud of using a Made in India Phone...Definitely recommend to buy this..

  after two weeks usage...Camera is good. Battery is perfect after full charging, works for around one and half day (I am not into gaming). Fast charging (takes about 1 and half hour for full charge 6000mh battery). Looks-wise good, But need back cover as  easily gets fingerprints and scratches on back. Display is perfect. Performance wise, sometimes I found lags while typing for msgs. (which, I hope will not be there after software update).  Speaker sound is not good (as per my view), sometimes need to be on full volume to listen some videos or phone call using speaker (don't know if the original video's sound is low or its speaker of phone). Not checked how reverse charging works.

  This is a most effective workhorse from Samsung's stable. It is a workaholic as its battery 🔋 keep working tirelessly for long duration.  My other phone is Samsung Note 9 and the battery of M35s gives better results.As far as camera is concerned,  it gives best performance in its class even during night and in feeble light and capture every detail as can be seen from the live shots taken by me.  The selfie quality is equally excellent.  The fingerprint reader is strategically placed and is effective.  The processor is excellent and the other features and Samsung apps like max and health makes it more useful.Last but not the least the design and appearance is very classy and the grip is good.You get the bang for your buck literally.

  I have really grown to love this phone. The samoled display is awesome and the infinity o display looks stunning. The battery is big but the actual backup fails to match up without optimization but is still better than most. The camera is great in outdoor lighting, especially for natural landscapes and the focus is fast and really works well. But the front camera, especially in indoor lighting is a little disappointing.  Also I am not a fan of side mounted fingerprint. With a cover in place it gets really inconvenient. The processor could have been better as well. But the security provided by Knox is a big plus. Also, I am in love with the gradient design on the back that is very elegant. The usb C to usb C cable is a great addition and the charge sharing with other phones has great utility. Overall it is great value for money from a leading brand and I would totally recommend it.

Big problem is there when you will do any work when its on charging there's a BUZZING  SOUND apperars along with any sound from your phone. It's really a annoying  issue  I have faced with this phone. I have already complaint it to Amazon and asked for replacement with the same one as early as possible.

Battery life is amazing and superfast charger fills the battery up in 1 hour and it lasts about more than 1 day on moderate usage.

  The following issues were present with my unit:- Headphone jack has persistent buzzing noise when any sound is being played. This is prominent when there are low volume sounds in videos/games/music- Front camera is giving washed out images- Battery is getting heated quickly on intensive tasks such as gaming within 10 mins.Contacted Amazon customer service and a Samsung technician was sent to my place. He elaborated that these are known issues and there are no fixes. The buzzing noise is a hardware issue itself! Even though there are known hardware defects in most units, Amazon is not willing to acknowledge and recall them.I am in the process of a receiving a replacement unit and Amazon has delayed that aswell! This cheap tactic might be to receive the replacement unit as close to the end of the sale, so that if that unit also has these issues, I will have to contact Amazon Customer Service to initiate refund. By this time, the sale would have ended.Unhappy with this phone purchase experience. It is better to opt for m51 as I have not heard any hardware issues as of yet.

  Completely satisfied with the product. Much better than expected. Fingerprint works lightning fast. Face unlock too works superfast and fine. Completely out of words to describe the Super Amoled display....it's  the best display I have ever seen. Darks are deep, colors are crisp. Mono speaker given is superb and has deep bass. Plastic  given at the back is good looking but won't be as good as a glass, though it would increase the price and weight of the set. I have got a good battery life. After using various tasks like YouTube, Fb, Insta, Spotify, etc... back to back for 1hr 30min, only 11% was drained. Blue light filter and Always on display is really useful.  Most liked feature for me is the thin chin which gives a bezelles feel.Iam not a gamer, 9611 processor is superb fine and lightning fast for my job. I thought  the processor would be bad, when watching YouTube reviews. After using it for a day with the normal apps we use daily(except games), I'm far more than satisfied. I would surely recommend this phone if you are not a gamer.For me the only negative I felt was that we could only add 3 fingerprints and 1 face data.

  First of all I want to talk about  camera.The rear camera is simply awesome in daylight conditions, and coming to front camera it is slightly disappointing but overall camera quality is super when compared to other mobile phones i  this price rangeNext we coming to battery, it is simply awesome ,if you are a hard user then it will give a backup for 1 day, if you are a lite user then it will give 1.5 to 2 days backup.It is very good mobile with good performance .This phone is not for pubg gaming and now you can choose this because it is banned in our country (India).Next it is the best Non Chinese smart phone under 20000 ,You can blindly choose this mobile it you want to buy a non chinese smartphone with good features under 20k.If we talk about the built quality , backside comes with a plastic but which is very attractive like a glass.It looks pretty good to use ,inland feel is very good, this mobile comes with 6.5"" super ambled screen which is another plus point. Which other brands do not provide under this segment.Overall I felt happy with this ...It justifies the price..

  Perfect phone at this range.Great display with punchy colour , viewing angle ,deep blacks and much more.From 6000 MH battery I am getting more than 12 hours of screen on time everyday with 15% remaining at the end of the day. With the help of 25 Watt fast charger I can charge my phone from 0 to 100% within 1 hour 40 minutes.64 megapixel camera is just spellbound. It can click exceptional photos in daylight as well as in night condition. Single track feature is awesome.Software experience is also great. Most importantly the software brings lots of privacy features which no other phone in this price segment can't provide. One UI brings lots of cool features which other brands can't provide.The processing power as well as the ram management is great. Generally I play lots of games like call of duty , pubg  everyday and I have not experienced any kind of lag. Everything works smooth.So overall I can say, this phone what every buck I have spent on it and I am completely satisfied with everything it provides.If anyone is planning to buy this phone, I want to tell them "" don't hesitate"" .

  This phone is a perfect fit for casual users who are far from any intense computing apps. The processor is decent to be tasked for browsing, running communication apps, social media, playing games, etc.. Some of the biggest plus of this device are.. 1.Display Quality, 2. User Interface. 3. Battery Size 4. Power Adopter 5. Endurance and 6. Brand Value/Assurance.7. Camera performance. Though I personally didn't like the back panel, its unreasonably glossy and a fingerprint magnet,My overall experience with this device is 4.6/5, given the price I bought it for 14.8K  after exchange.Overall its a good option for average and above average users in this price segment.

  All aspects of the phone are amazing!!Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Single shot option is very handy. Live focus and acro mode are amazing. Can say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some other good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome and get reverse charging which is a plus.Good display and screen size. Fun to watch HD videos.Not tried gaming yet but assume it will be good compared to other phones of this range.OS is very friendly if u have been using samsungfor a long time, u wont have any problem.Very handy finger sensor on the side.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say.*Good phone worth every penny*

  Samsung M31s, Starting off with the look of this phone it’s really sleek infact one of the sleekest phones I’ve purchased so far apart from that it is really lightweight as well so it does not feel as if I am carrying a stone or a brick in my pocket. While holding the phone, it feels really premium. It has got 4 camera’s, it has 64 main cameras with F 1.9 and 12 MP ultra-wide camera so it makes it really easy for me to click large and beautiful photos but it if you zoom if picture has been clicked by rare camera it looks kind of blurry but from a distance it looks crystal clear. It has one of the best battery you can get in the today’s market which can easily last a day or two. It has a SUPER AMOLED infinity O display so I enjoy watching a movie in this phone without any disturbance and Colour textures are really clear if you are watching or looking at something, Processor is not extraordinary though it’s more than enough for a normal phone user. If you are looking for a phone which is sleek has a high battery backup, clicks good pictures, and has the best Screen, Well then this is no brainer for you.Just for it!

Haven't  played games though but it can survive a day even under extreme usage .Built - Sturdy yet elegant.Camera - In this segment it provides a decent setup  Low light or night photography is a plus point.Side Finger print- 95% responsive rate .Price Point is a Impressive .Cons  - Processor - Snapdragon should have been better.Refresh Rate - Atleast 90Hz is a must. Lags can be noticed while playing games .Face Recognition- Is not always that smooth. One Plus and Apple are way better and quicker.Specially in low light FR is unresponsive.5G is missing .

  Hi Guys, I got my phone on 15th Aug and I have tested battery life by playing Asphalt and other games for about 2 hour. Watch Amazon video for 3 hours and some random phone functions and after 7-8 hours of use battery is still at 60% which is quite good.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is also good compare to my early phone M40. And it unlock quite fast.Camera quality is also very good. I have attached few clicks with different camera modes. I am very happy with camera results.8gb ram gives quite a boost and game play is quite smooth.Overall happy with my purchase and quite good and impressive for budget phone.

  The best phone I have ever got in my budget.As a true samsung customer, I have always prefered samung for any electronic device because of the trust samsung has built in my life. My new samsung galaxy M31s is just a monster. It has a large screen of 6.5 inches which makes it look classy in my hand. First I thought I should preffer snapdragon but its exynos 9611 processor completely changed my mind. I can play heavy games without any lag. The fingerprint scanner is just at its appropriate place and is way too fast. The Battery of 6000 maH is just a beast which is supported by its 25 watt super fast charger. Camera is just way beyond my expectations, ita very natural and great. At last this is great device in a very usual budget.

   The best one could have for such a decent price range..!!The design of the mobile is extremely impressive most importantly the integration of the finger print sensor in the right side.The smartphone gives a premium touch and feel mostly because of metal rim and gradient over back of the phone. The camera is well equipped with AI technology, the suggestions and improvements done by camera are no doubt impressive and appreciatiable compared to other devices.There are some areas where Samsung must have worked upon like increasing the sensibility of the finger print sensor, the time taken to recognize and  login the device is significantly large compared to other devices.Overall, the mobile is a good to purchase and recommendable to anyone who is looking for a mid range mobile.

  After tones of research i bought it.If u are willing to buy non-Chinese phone under 20k this is d one.Looking for some good quality pictures and best stabilized videos, just go for it u wont regret as it has sony's primary camera. wide angle is just wow.I have 6 gb variant till now didn't see any  lag and while playing games also performance was well.As its huge battery easliy gives screen  time upto 2 days on normal usage.Initally was concerned about its charging time but after 4 to 5 uses it shows up its true power. I got nearly 60% in just 45 mins compared to battery its best I think. Would like to add, while face unlock little white light shines around camera it looks cool. I will share pic.Those color shades at back panel gives it classy look .In hand feel is also solid.

  Samsung M31s provides a smooth experience in day to day experience. The works seamlessly in normal operations including surfing and streaming social media and other platforms.The camera setup is also decent and provides detailed images with good saturation. Monster shot feature is also fun. Wide angle works perfectly in both front and back cameras.Battery backup is the USP of the product. It is really a beast performer. It can easily last 2 days with moderate usage and even last more than a day easily for a high usage. It is currently the best in the price segment and even in the price above it.Overall, I can say that the phone is best for a moderate user with a little bit of gaming. However, I have witnessed that the phone lags some times even without any high usage. That is really a spoiler. So, in all I can say that it is a decent package in its price range and you can spend your money for this.

(But it is much faster than my earlier J7Prime. So okay for me).Blank screen displaying %charging is a nice addition. Wish the mobile also chimes and makes noice once charging is nearly complete!

  I got this Samsung Galaxy M31s in first sale, and reviewing it after 8days of usage. I can say this phone is really good in this price segment. And Camera is really good and the processor exynos 9611 is old but there's no issue with it. I played PUBG MOBILE on it On HDR Ultra and I got 40 fps continues and in this price segment there's no phone who supported  HDR Ultra. Phone comes with 6000 Mah Battery and I can say it will give you one and half day backup with normal usage and in hard-core usage you'll get 15 to 18 hours backup with continuous usage. This phone comes with Knox security so it's really good. You have no privacy issue with it. Overall it's a best phone when it comes to Display, Battery,  Camera, Processor everything is good. This is my detailed review on this. And you're looking good smartphone. Go for it 😊

AMAZING I could say. The feel, the display quality, the response time is great. About the quad camera, it has features like capturing in slowmo, panorama, macro and a special one to capture food 😀. Although there are many apps already installed, you can outsource. The picture in picture feature is by far best so that I can switch between apps instantly. The operating is quite the same as anySamsung phone is as I'd a Samsung one earlier, I didn't find a problem to operate it. Battery lasts for about 2 days if not over used. I would highly recommend this phone at this price.

Coming to its display so there is no doubt that on other company was better more than smasungSo here I conclude that in this price range this is the best phone I can ever get and without any single thought go for this phone

  Pros1. Excellent battery. Used heavily with 100% charged and didn't exhaust for almost 18 hours(19% battery status)2. Samsung M31s is secured by Knox. This is the best feature that you can get. It is useful for data security.3. Screen is super clear and bright. I feel comfortable using this screen compared to honor 6X device which used to stress my eyes a lot.4. Sound quality is super duper good. Very crisp, clear and loud voice on phone call and media usage.Cons:Slight heavy comparitively.Device is slight tall which I personally dont like.Now, I need to check on the network bandwith compatibility when you travel abroad  say USA, UK , Europe or anyother country. As I experience, I will update you all with honest review.I strongly recommend ""BUY"" if anyone interested in Samsung or non-chinese brand with budget of 20k.Happy shopping!

  I really liked the Samsung m31s phone. This phone is giving me a great performance in terms of camera quality, its display and long lasting battery.  I did not see any heating issue in the phone yet.  I saw only 2 drawbacks in this mobile.  First, if this phone replaces the Exynos 9611 processor, Snapdragon would have a powerful processor and second, this phone does not have a Knox Security folder, if it were both, then the phone would have been better.

    Disappointed with the actual working & battery
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I was disappointed with Samsung M31s due to following reasons. I have been using this phone for more than a month now1. The phone hangs sometimes. Again need to lock & unlock to make it running.2. Battery charging time time is long unlike the the claim of fast charging. I was earlier using Nokia 8 which has faster battery charging.3. Cannot change the screen when call is coming. Has to wait for the call to disconnect.4. Battery storage capacity is not good in actual although it is mentioned as USP of this product. It did not last one day also with average use.I feel kind of cheated as the claim mentioned by Samsung is actually not fully true.I think that there should be Indian government owned certification agency which should test the phone before launch to prevent wrong claim by these mobile phone companies.The above opinion is my personal opinion.

  Battery life is pretty good. Also, the fast charging is quite quick. It has reverse charging as well.Fingerprint reader is really quick. It takes less than a second to unlock when it does. But there are times when it wouldn't unlock after multiple attempts. That is the only issue I faced.Camera quality is great. With the introduction of AI, the single take feature lets you capture multiple photos, vedios, boomerang in just one click. So, you don't really have to decide whether you want to the moment in a vedio or photograph.Rest it does justice to all features and is quite a catch at the price. It is a great handset to have if you are not a compulsive gamer. Though the added accessories such as phone cover and headset would have been a great addition to the kit. Especially the phone cover since when a phone is newly launched there are not many compatible options available in market.

  I was but apprehensive about buying this phone but it has turned out to be a perfect buy for me. I'm using this as my secondary phone but I could very well use it as primary phone too. I especially love the Glance feature. I lock my phone most times just to see those stories on my lockscreen. Camera quality with proper day light is really good, however night ones or with dark lights are not so great. Battery life is the best feature I'd say. I use the phone mostly for office work and it lasts me well over two day!!! So I'd say 10thums up for battery.

  I was using this device since a week, it's a good device having stunning super Amoled Display and massive 6000mah batter which runs 2 days for lite users. For moderate users it's easily lasting for 1.5 days. Only the thing I noticed bit annoying is while I am in a call with full volume there will be small vibrations occurs at the back panel as the back panel of Galaxy M31s is comes with polycarbonate material. And there should be a pre applied screengaurd and back case. All other competitors are providing but Samsung is not providing in their M series phones. If they could provide it then it will be getting 5 start from my perspective.

  FINGERPRINT READER- Fast and good.CAMERA - Amazing. Samsung took camera to another level with this. The image processing is very good. But surely needs some updates with focus and all.SCREEN - Very very good. Needless to sayBATTERY - Good but not the 6000 mah standard. Needs better optimization.PROCESSOR - Very average. Reason why i gave 4 stars. Does the job for me as I am not a gamer. I'm a photographer but I've experienced lags on occasions. Also it lags sometimes while clicking pictures, specially when you or the subject is moving.Would recommend for sure.

   I'm writing this review after using Samsung Galaxy M31s for more than 15 days.I am giving a 5 star because...The camera quality is great, the details are very good in macro shots.  Wide angle shots, live focus is working very well. Find some attachment I've added with it that tells quality of camera. Video stbilization is quite good.  Battery life is very good, once fully charged, the battery lasts for about a day and a half.  I really like the fingerprint sensor and lock key combination and they work very well.It's awesome for me, if you are looking for under 20K then Samsung Galaxy M31s is one of the best choice that I've experienced. It comes with very interesting features like navigation menu.Just loved it.

  The phone is having amazing features like1) Camera - Photos are great when clicked through Front cam and Rear cam. They look a lot natural when compared to several pre-installed beauty filters on the new age phones. Single Take option, Slow-Mo options are simply superb.2) Battery - Great battery backup. Phone has enough juice to last 2 days on normal usage and 1.5 days on heavy usage.3) 25W Fast Charger - Whole charging time from 0-100 takes only 2 hours. Thats simply great when you have 6000mAh battery.4) Display - Amoled Display shows vivid colours. Videos,  Movies are great to be watched on M31S.5) UI - OneUI interface is simply superb. Touch sampling rate is also good.In Total, Amazed by the Samsung Galaxy M31S. Kudos to whole Samsung Team for bringing a great smartphone in this budget range. This is the new midrange King!!!

  I'm seriously not expecting this phone to be proved so efficient and effective. I had a plan for buying Redmi note 9 pro max,which falls under the same price range of this phone. But I had trusted this brand,Samsung more than any other Chinese as well as non Chinese brands so opted to go for this phone on 12thAug and got before the delivery date. I'm using this phone for more than a month. I have decided that this is the perfect time for me to give genuine review. BELIVE ME! Exynos 9611 processor is not at all the worst idea, it performs similar to the Snapdragons or Abionics or helios. So without any turbulence go for this phone. Camera is amazing, display is awesome, battery is alluring, Dolby Atmos is audacious. All together this phone is A++

This service center analyzed and and confirmed that it is a screen hardware issue. They said hardware is available, So, they will fix the screen issue.I have been using Samsung mobiles for long time.

  First of all... the look is way too gud for mirage black. But it depends on your choice of colors.The fingerprint reader is very sensitive and it was better if it let us couple of more fingerprints to unlock phoneBattery with 6000 mAH and superfast charging is more than enough for moderate users and reverse charging is a useful feature.Camera quality is very good and single take feature is very handy for active social media person.Display is very immersive. 6GB RAM is overkill for any mobile game.It's a better choice than Galaxy M51 if you can compromise slightly with processor and a 1000 mAH less battery, rest all same as M51 in M31s, it will save your ₹5000.It's the best phone in the market at this time with this price. Plus it's samsung not chienese so its reliable and long lasting.

I play 30-40 pubg games daily stream youtube twitter instagram facebook  but still 20% battery is still remaining by midnight. Camera quality is superb unless you wish to do professional photography.Display is excellent, its like watching on a led tv, no frame skips in pubg, voice calling is hd and even video call is very good.Only issue i find is that it starts heating after an hour or two while using heavy apps.If you are looking to buy any new mobile other than chinese than go for it.Now they are launching m51 also, i thing you should go for it than m31s only because of its processor that us 730g and 7000 mah battery..... it is like using a powerbank😅😅

This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??Overall a great phone.

Battery life is adequate to my usage and I can fully run my day given my TCONs & music ,photography etc usagefs I am happy with the battery life& is 4*. Just one star less as I see it takes longer to get fully charged than my current one plus. Finger print reader is definitely an another safety advantage & is location & accuracy are good. Size,shape, color ,touch response I have no complaints. All in all I would rate it FIVE for making me happy & giving great Value for my money.

  This a decent phone in this price. The 6000 mah  battery adds a little weight to the phone. To adjust this Samsung has given a plastic body to the which is a drawback. The box comes with the device and the charger. Fast charging is amazing. The phone does heat up a bit. Finger print unlocking is pretty quick. I didn't like the face unlock as you have swipe once the face is detected. The pprocessor nd the RAM proved good speed while switching through apps. Camera is a powerful feature for this phone. It is extremely  good. providesOverall its a nice phone, worth the buy. It feels good in the hand and is easy to use. The plastic body is the only disappointment.

  As always another great product from Samsung... The battery is so great, it's like carrying a power bank with you. sometimes I forget to charge.All the cameras are great, no need of purchasing a DSLR if you want buy either a phone or camera...I bought the 8 GB ram so the phone is very responsive and quick...And 128 GB is more than enough to store all the videos and photos I had stored on cloud...all in all a great  budget phone...

  Samsung m31s is a decent device for me its really good and loaded with massive features .1.camera is excellent no doubt in camera.2. Battery also outstanding its takes 1 hr and few min to fully and can run 1.5 days and more in normal use.3.fingerprint scanner also good and you can use it to pull down the notifications without touching screen from the bottom.4.face unlock is very much good then i expected.5.display is the specialty of Samsung so no review on it.6. Processor: That's disappointed me but after more than 20 days use i realize its really fast due to Samsung one UI optimization its like butter to use.7.body: in image its look boring but trust me its looks gorgeous on hand. But you need to apply a guard on it bcoz its easily get scratchesSpeaker: is decent and enough loud.

It's look is premium battery life is awsome but one thing that dissapointed me alot is that it doesn't have in built-in screen recording option you have to download the app for the same and also the camera quality is super but in low light tha front camera clicks poor images that means the overall picture seems too haavee tooo many pixels that's why but if you click selfies in day light 😍😍😍😍 the picture quality iss very very good it seems like you clicked it thorough a very good camera bcoz it has an amazing 32 mp camera overall the phone is very . I recommend you to buy this phone if your range is near about 20,000 .

  hope this is helpful for you guys who are thinking of buying this phone. it's been approx one month of using this phone, there are two good thing about this phone is, 1. It has great camera- so if you are buying this for camera or photography purpose just go for it. 2. Battery life- it has a great  battery backup lasts upto two days even if u uses it the whole day also it gets charge really fast. Tried n tested.Now the only cons in this phone is that it gets hang or sometimes freeze.I have been an iPhone user n now switched to Android phones. So I find this hang/freezing issue little bit annoying coz it never happen in an iPhoneOver all it is a good phone if u buying it for camera n battery life.

  I bought this phone as it was having a good value of price and the configuration given justified the price points. Always wanted to switch back to Samsung and after many years using a Samsung phone I have realised I have made the right choice. Talking about the phone, the Super Amoled Display is wonderful, the battery is reliable and it gets completely charged exactly in 100-105 mins. And will last you 30-35 hrs with extremely high usage too. The camera is decent and has multiple features, Single Take being one good one and Low Light Picture quality too is very good(image attached) . Many customizations are possible, and the user interface is also very good. Recommended for who are looking for High Value & Performance phone.

  I recommened this smartphone to every student because it has all its features that student wants in a smartphone.1) Perfect battery life - Charge the battery once a day. If you are a normal user using social media, watching videos and play normal games, the battey at the end of the day will be about 45-50 %. There is also an option high power saving mode it help to make your powered on upto 3-4 days.2) Performance - I didnt see lag on playing highly performance games on HD qualtiy ex. Call of Duty.I can play almost about 9.5 hrs - 12 hrs of gameplay nonstop on 100 - 0 %.3) Camera - The best camera for photoshoots and editing, travelling, food blogging, vlogging.Just make sure that put a back cover to protect the back from scratches and apply a tempered glass for extra protection.

  A great package by Samsung, amidst time of protest against Chinese brands , under 20,000.The design is cool,looks fab.The fingerprint sense is  fast though face lock is not up to the mark but still it works. The phone has many virtues as ui 2.1(core),AR , BIXBI , etc. but the show is stolen by the BATTERY and DISPLAY ( Super Amoled with Punchole camera) . The display is too good and you haven't got any words for the battery backup.Performance is stable while gaming but if you aren't a gamer then its the best choice . Now when PUBG has been banned , M31s can be stated as the best smartphone for Indians ( against China) within a budget of 20K.Amazon delivery also gotta be appreciated. They delivered it within 3 days of order.You can pay by your choice .May you have a great experience with the phone.🙂😀😊

  Good phone! It's been 2 months since I'm using Samsung M31s and I've noticed, it's got a sustainable battery life. The camera is also great. While the speakers and sound quality is good.. However, when you speak on a call the receiver end sometimes can't hear your voice. You need to be extra loud or hold the phone closer to your mouth for them to hear what your saying. This wasn't the issue in my previous Samsung mobile phone because I used to talk on loud speaker with the mobile on my desk while I work. But now I can't multi-task and have to hold it closer to my face while speaking. I wonder if this issue is with my phone in particular or others are facing the same problem.Apart from this, over all it's a great phone in this price range.

  The phone is great. Mine is the 8gb ram and the price(₹21499) is pretty fair(If Samsung decreases the price, man it will be the best phone you can get in that budget).The display is superb.🤩The camera especially is too good. I wanted a phone with a good camera and the galaxy m31s is way more than I expected. The 64mp, live focus(depth), macro and all are really nice. 👌Fingerprint sensor is fast enough. Battery life is also good. It depends on your usage. I am not into gaming so a full charge lasts for almost 2 days(more if u don't use at all😅)The 25w fast charger charges the 6000mah battery pretty fast.I liked the finishing of the phone.

  First of all speaking about the camera, the Samsung m31s has an excellent camera with 64MP camera and also additionally with single take feature which is the super highlight. The camera has excellent quality and clarity.Speaking about the battery WOW...because it has 6000mah battery which lasts longer than I expected. Additionally with reverse charging which is a icing on the cake.Also the display is very crystal clear and has a very greater resolution. The mobile also has a good processor. Also highly and fast recognizing fingerprint and face unlock.The mobile's external appearance also gives a classy look especially mirage blue.To conclude from my experience the Samsung galaxy m31s is one of the best mobiles in 2020.

  Points why to buy this:Camera - we cannot expect anything better, performance beyond its price. Deep capture of color shades in the frame.Battery - Gives highest supportFingerPrint - is average, since the same button is used for lock and fingerprint sensor. These both can be kept seperate.Dislikes:There is no earphone and back cover with the pack which we usually get with latest phones. This can be considered to be added as it is very basic need for phone.Its quite heavy, can be considered to make little lesser in weight and slim in sizeFinger print sensor can be provisioned separate instead of using lock button for the same.

  Camera quality: 64MP and 32MP rear and front is just for name sake, camera is worst. Images even in 64MB comes out blurr. If you are looking out for good camera don't ever go for this mobile. You can't zoom when u have set 32MB in front camera. I was looking for a good camera mobile but samsung has disappointed me.

   After just 10days the product had a blue dot on the screen which spreads and eventually covers the screen, but Samsung is least bothered to understand the situation that there was no physical damage or pressure given on the phone, as seen in the video there's not even a single scratch on the phone which proves it wasn't physically damaged, and the service center claims it as a physical damage and will try to prove it and take money from you. Keep extra 10k ready with you if you're going for this phone coz warranty does not cover the super amoled display and they told it is a common thing for the blue dot to happen and cover the screen . They won't do it under warranty and will take money from you whatsoever and will also take 10-15 days for the service

Your video will show black stripes on both sides.THIRD, if you want to cast your screen to TV using Anycast , you will rue your decision to buy this phone because when you cast to TV, your videos will not play smoothly. There will be jerks in videos. Stop-start, stop-start kind of interpruptios will make you to break your phone. This problem of miracast also exists in M30s model I bought earlier.

The fingerprint reader is sideways which sometimes annoys me bcz it is super sensitive and unlocks the phone instantly. Also, if you are considering this phone, you'll have to choose a phone cover keeping in mind that it won't block your access to the fingerprint reader.

A lot better than what other phone hyped about.2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery goes on for 2 days or more . Samsung has done a great job in battery department3.Camera: Impressive. Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall pretty good for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there but its pretty good. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is really fast.

Please give back case at-least. I bought in the first sale but I have to wait 15 days for the back cover.2. Please work on charging cable and make it tangle free.3. Too many unnecessary apps. Instead of that, install whatsapp,Instagram,Facebook etc.4. Face unlock is good but not impressive, it needs some more work to make it fast.

  All the aspects of the phone are good except performance.The phone heats up pretty quickly and the processor isn't powerful enough for few tasks.Especially if you have more than 100 apps installed in your phone. The 8gb  ram isn't compatible with the processor. Even though memory is available the processor isn't utilizing it fully...Don't get me wrong the phone works smooth for mediocre tasks but it disappoints when usage acceleratesAlso I feel the phone is kinda heavy.Charging is fast, and cameras are good. Nothing else to complaintAlso a dick move from Samsung is launching m51 within one month of launching this phone, I would have bought m51 with SD730G if knew it was releasing soon.

  It's a great phone. Good looking, feature packed, and a battery beast. Everything in this phone is great, with one exception. In my personal experience, I feel the side mount finger sensor, could've been more sensitive. Or better yet, it could have been a regular back mount sensor. The experience of the unlock isn't as smooth as the optic sensor found in the Samsung A series. The Samsung UI skin on top of the Android 10 os, doesn't feel heavy or annoying like the Xiomi or the Vivo, or the Oppo mid range phone. There aren't any advertisements on its built in apps either, which is a complete win for Samsung, and the User. Overall, I'd give this phone a 4.5/5.

  Phone operations are completely lag free and can multitask easily.Camera quality is nice.Charge withstanding capacity is very good. I always keep the data on condition and the battery easily stays for about 36 to 48 hours on a single charge of 100% with data ON.Fingerprint reader on the power button takes some time to get used to as it is easy when sensor is in front or rear of mobile. But sensitivity is good enough.Overall the phone is good. I feel Samsung has done well with this phone and the M series in total.The only problem I feel is the need to get a data cable as the charger cable supplied with the mobile is both side type C. So to connect to/charge from PC you need to get a separate data cable.

  Overall, I am very much satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy M31S since it has mind boggling advantages of the super 64MP quadcam giving you intense clarity in pictures and amazing picture quality with super amoled screen. And nevertheless the camera works perfectly fine even in low lights and at night as you can see in the pictures. The major benefit is from the 6000MAh super battery life with reverse charging feature as it gives you a huge backup with long playback times. If you're a frequent blogger or youtuber then this phone adds the cherry on top of your cake. Value for money in all means and almost a great handset to go for. This is my honest review after using the phone for almost 2 weeks and I hope for consistent performance throughout my future usage.

  Best feature of the phone is it's Display. It is an eye-pleasing display given that it's AMOLED and very good.Second best thing is 6000mAH battery with 25W charger (in-box).Some features of One UI are not good and compatible with all other devices (e.g. Screencast a.k.a. Smart View). OneUI is not completely optimized. Feels laggy. Could be due to two reasons - UI and Processor.For a price point of 20-22k, the processor is a bottleneck for sure. Performance isn't upto the other devices in this range.People who prefer snappy experience, might not enjoy the phone as much.Overall, 4/5 rating from my experience considering the offerings and shortcomings.

Also even after 8 gb ram I experience lag in simple games only.When messages or notifications are opened directly from notification bar, the phone again hangs and a black screen appears on the screen which stays for considerable time.Front camera quality is the worst I have seen.Sometimes the keypad does not appear when I have to type something.Lots of glitches in this waste phone.

  Friends. Let me tell about the phone in detail. If u r looking for non Chinese . Under 20000. Without any hesitation go for it. When I received the package from Amazon. And I opened the box was anti wrapped. Not like other brands which provides wrapper around the box. When u set up ur mobile. U just say wow by looking at the display. Coming to camera. It's awesome. Single take feature is killer and both front and rear camera are monster. Battery is as u now it's monster. Charging speed is up to mark. It takes 1.30mon to reach 95. Which is enough for all. And exynos 9611 is average processor and it runs smooth on day to day process. I have not played any pubg . But I think chipset won't disappoint u in day to day process.Ram management and storage are excellent. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock are quite decent. Over all very good package under 20000. Just go for it.

I was using Samsung Note for past 4 years with no complaints like this which made to purchase Samsung again.Rough handling people should think many a times before going for it , else you will lose your hard earned money,We have to find a strong protective cover to take care of the mobile , tempered glass and normal cover will be of no use since the edges are not been taken care

  This is one of the best phone available at the price range. Loved it.The fingerprint reader/scanner is just perfect.I feel side position should be the standard.Camera quality too is way better than m30s.The 8gb ram is just future proofing according to me.Don't even question the battery life. Lasts 2 days on average(with hours of online class everyday and other regular usage).The punch hole front camera is pretty much invisible if the screen is off and one won't even notice it during regular use.Only drawback is it is a bit expensive although it's features make up for the cost.10 on 10 would recommend to others.These are some of the pics taken in the Western Ghats

  Overall uses are good, I am new to Samsung felt nice, camera performance is very good, and battery back up will surprise u definitely. If u are not a gamer u must prefer this phone for average usage.it gives around 8hour backup.Guys, I am a mediocre gamer, as per my view this phone is not meant for gaming at all, so don't prefer If u likes gaming.The processor can't handle pubg graphics, it supports HD and ultra graphics but the phone cant handle it...And I compared it to real me x with snapdragon 712, I liked the display of realme x compared to Samsung m31s.So wait for Samsung m51.Becoz exynos 9611 is comparable to snapdragon 665.If u have any doubt u can ask me I will clear it, I am using this since 15 days

  The phone I got from Amazon is defective, the wide angle camera is dislocated, completely off center, there's also a tilt if you hold the camera horizontally & if you put flash light over the camera then inner of camera is visible.I don't just believe that until I show the phone to my local samsung service center, retailer & trusted repair shop. All were agreed on defects of camera.When you paying this much of amount then you don't expect such defects & the packing material (box) is to cheap. Samsung destroyed my trust in seconds.If Samsung India reading this then tell me reason why I buy your product again?My refund is under process, let's see what happen.

  Rear camera is a winner here but front camera doesnt perform like it's 32mp. If samsung can fix it with a software update it would be great. The single take feature is another attraction to go for this phone. Battery life is good..last a day with normal usage. Don't expect more than that. Processor is slow to be frank, have seen lags quite a time in app opening and network connectivity too. Overall it is a mix of both pros and cons. If your only concern is the camera quality it would be a good choice to pick this phone but again it is not best for selfies. Samsung really need to fix this.

And I have come to the conclusion that the youtuber show us the comparison between the chinese brands and samsung in new condision. But the fact is the performance of chinese brand decreases with time. But the performance of samsung camera, battery, chipset does not decreases. Just compare the chinese brand with samsung after 6 months or 1 year uses, then you can understand. As I used more than 16 smartphones of various brands like mi, oppo, vivo and I know that fact.

  I personally liked this product. Here are some disadvantages which I noticed in this phone. First, processor, it lags many times, but I don't like heavy games so it is quite good for me. Second, there is no any inbuilt screen recorder. Third, unavailability of S Secure folder. If you want to to secure your personal data then you have to choose other apps for that. But, overall it is a good phone for me. It's camera quality is briliant and network quality is also better than other chinese handsets. Lookwise and display is awesome and most important it can be used by single hand. There are not so many installed app in this phone. So there are a lots of space in this handset for your data.

Can't ask for me at this price. I am not a great user of camera, but what ever mild use I do found the camera pictures and videos quality to be far far better than previous phones.

  Other than it's battery life that's was supposed to last 3 days that everyone claims( but in reality it lasts for a day or day n half only and charging your phone once in a day is not a big deal), rest all features are exactly same as they marketed this phone. And it's design (gradient back) literally killer. Earlier I thought it will be a bit big for my palm but now it's like part of my palm..LOL.Fingerprint reader: it's fast and accurate.Battery life: it's really good but not as they marketed..LOLCamera quality: I don't use camera much but a few experiences that I had with this was up to the mark. And I liked how the picture came out even in dark.

Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable. Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive. Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4.

   This phone's fingerprint works very well and very accurately And the performance of this phone's battery is excellent, once full charged, it can run for 1.5 days comfortably even after heavy use. The battery of this phone is fully charged in about 1 hour 20 minutes. Talking about the camera, the camera quality of this phone is very excellent, especially its single take feature was very good. And talking about the degine and build quality of this phone, it looks great and premium, the weight of the phone is also very right Speaking with my experience, I liked this phone very much and in this price range this phone may be the best phone👌👌

  Best display, best battery and the best phone in this price range. I am enjoying this phone. Even light gaming is possible. RAM management is the best. I will also recommend this phone in this price range. It comes with Knox security. Not as strong as A series but better than nothing. This makes the phone the most secure device in this range.

  Hello users Samsung m31s I deeply check each and everything here is my honestly review if we talk about phone then overall rating I give 4.5 🌟  I speratelist of spec of phone battery drain no problem because monster 6000mAh capacity.Second thing camera so guys in my opinion camera is absolutely good compared to this range 20k budget phone. There is no issue such heat up or lagging in performance good at everywhere in daily uses.Two big thing lapse that can be placed one processor at least snapdragon 720g or 730 processor and screen could have been better gorilla glass 5 front side as well back side.At last one thing I'll describe attraction of phone really fantastic as samsung s series phones. Best phone under 20k.

  Firstly,  Samsung M31s is not better than M31. I'm almost used 6 months M31 so on that performance I will say both phone are performing same. This phone is only perfome over m31 is for finger print reader, battery charging and camera level.Cons:1.Very poor battery performance as 6000mah is not the correct backup, actually this one is 3000mah2.Very lag phone and its not recommended for gaming especially Pubg, Freeware is not recommended un this phone.3. Sometimes its got hang.Camera - 4/5Battery backup- 2.5/5Fast charging- 5/5Fingerprint  - 5/5Face Unlock - 3/5CPU - 3/5Display Clarity- 5/5Sound - 2.5/5Network receiving capacity-3.5/5

  Overall perfection of m31s is GreatDisplay is amazing.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone,it flet like premium A seriesFP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side.Everything  is fine but network issues with jio sim but processing speed of app is acceptable.

  After going through lots of reviews from other  users and watching YouTube videos, i have opted this phone for my day to day usage. I am writing this review after using this phone for 3 days. Here's my observation:This phone is absolutely not for the gamers.Finger print response is not quick.Takes tame for processing the images once you click the camera. But could see excellent images are coming out.I could see bit lag while playing carrot pool online game(I doubt whether this could be able to handle call of duty, smoothly!).Rest all is good on this phone and works perfect.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Samsung galaxy M31s is one hell of a product. with excellent features and a great price. as every other review have noted out, there is no clear case provided in the standard pack, which i guess should have been mandatory at this price.the one issue is the build of the body. As the body is plastic, it tends to get a lot of scratches too fast, too soon. even with the cover on , any slight scratch is permanent, and no matter how hard you try to clean it, the stains wont just go. Body build need to improve.great product, needs build quality improvement.

  Its been 2 weeks since I have been using this phone and I can say that in terms of battery it is the best phone I have used till now. Yesterday I chargered it after almost 2.5 days. I watch Youtube and other stuff in phone and also use it for social media.Other good things is it's camera. Picture quality is quite nice in 64MP mode. White balance is also good. Colours shown are natural.The Speaker on the phone is also according to my taste, i.e it has punchy sound. I dont like stereo speaker as they generally lack bass.Now talking about its display quality, as you know about samsung display, there are just Awsome💯.Overall I can say it is the best phone for those who do not play heavy games on their phones.

  This is a review after using this phone for one week. I felt that Samsung galaxy m31s has delivered what is expected from it inspire of its processor. This is my first Samsung mobile previously I was on redmi note4 pro. When compared to some bang for buck Chinese mobiles Samsung's software has lot to offer for example popup windows, focus mode, black and white mode for digital wellbeing. Battery and display are solid. Camera is good for this price point. Processor does the job from the point of view of a non gamer.Cons:-1)Finger print sensor needs some tweaks2)Should have provided atleast a cover

  Despite its large 6.5-inch screen, I like how the phone feels in the hand. It’s light, and easy to hold and use one hand. It’s a tall phone, though. The Galaxy M31s doesn’t look too flashy, but I am okay with that. But Samsung does cut some corners to keep the price down. Like the Galaxy A51, the M31s’s back panel is made of plastic with a glass-like finish, but you probably wouldn’t be able to differentiate. Still, the build quality is solid, though there is no waterproof rating.

  CONS:1) Lags and Heating issues while gaming even with medium graphics.2) 64MP mode does not look good.3) If the screen goes off while u are in a page or any app, it forces us to lock and unlock the device twice for the page or app to respond.4) The glasstic back is very prompt to scratches. You definitely need a back case. NO use of giving a good look with no scratch resistant.PROS:1) INTELLI CAM really does well2) No noise in the images but feels like the sharpness misses a bit.3) Display is awesome as always.4) Punch hole does not feel to distract you5) doesn't feel too heavy for a 6000MAh battery.

They said that the phone can't be repaired and they will collect the phone with original bill with box and full amount will be refunded through the Samsung shop coupon. Then again I went to submit the phone to service center but this time they said that this will be repaired in 7 days...

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 sports a 6.4-inch full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display. Whereas, the Galaxy M31s sports a slightly larger 6.5-inch full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-O display. Galaxy M31s seems to have a different body this time around, even though it oddly doesn't look all that different at first glance. Yet, there are enough changes here that need to go through a fine-toothed comb. These changes do subtly change the way you use the phone.A glasstic body that looks and feels greatA vibrant 6.5-inch hole-punch Super AMOLED displayA 64MP (IMX682) primary camera by Sony that replaces a similar one made by SamsungAnd faster 25W wired charging.

Battery life is nice too.i m not a big deal gamer so my battery works for so long that I recharge once in 2days. I still like traditional fingerprint scanner, one behind the phone, however this too is ok for me.

  Under 24k phones of Samsung has same Exynos processor. As for design, let me tell you, other Redmi and etc too offer Punch hole camera but the LCD display(though 90Hz) around punch hole is a bit dim, as compared to Samsung due to sAMOLED 60Hz panel. Performance till now has been upto the mark. Snapdragon in Redmi and etc are powerful but as the phone gets heated the performance is lowered to a great extent, while there is very little drop in performance in Samsung M31s. 64MP sensor is awesome, Front Camera is also good, the thing is its all about the post processing of image. All in all I would suggest to go for M31s.

  Getting auto restarted almost daily..! With minimum RAM usage and no apps open.When I ordered this, 2 things were in mind. 1st was to give a try to a brand not owned by a particular 'dushman desh'. 2nd was the battery. Considering this, I am satisfied.  Good Camera Outputs could be of help but the phone doesn't live upto the mark. After using for 50 days now, I am disappointed with the display and its touch sensitivity.  It hangs at least 3 times a day. A user which never plays high games cannot expect this from a 6gb RAM wala Phone. Everything else give satisfactory experience.All in all, Samsung will get more customers here in India if they spend more in R&D.

Once u charge it completely, it easily lasts for 2 days. It takes around 1 and a half hour to completely charge the big battery. It boasts of a Super amoled display which  is matchless; viewing angles are clean and crisp. Loved to watch any content on the phone.

  One star additional for this being a high quality non-chinese product. This phone is very good, no doubt about it. Main camera great, selfie camera equally high octane feature, battery life really superb. My consumption made even Redmi Note 4 full battery dry up to 30% by 6 pm, that is 60% or more till same time in case of this M31s.Overall superb buy. Sole drawback is slightly higher weight of phone, but that also is obviously on account of a power house battery of 6000 mah.Best phone in this range.But avoid any other phone with even more high battery mah. Weight would go up drastically.This one is optimally the best buy.

  If you are planning to buy this mobile then go ahead. I'm writing this review after using this mobile for 1 month. The features are really well designed and executed,1. The glastick body gives your mobile proper protection if it's falls sometime.2. The fingerprint reader, face recognition really works great.3. Camera Quality is excellent even in no light one can capture a best shot with night mode, also live focus, motion photo, slow motion and many more options are well appreciated.4. Though it take little extra time to charge a mobile, but that extra time almost last for approx more than 48 hrs of battery life.Overall a great product by Samsung team.

  1. Phone is very slow due to its processor 👎2. Sometimes its struggle to load contacts 👎3. Battery is good enough 👍4. Display is good enough 👍5. Camera is ok 👊6. Fingerprint scanner is good but placement is not correct I think.  Side mount is not good in my view👈👉Final verdict:  Price is too high for this phone. Costing 20000 not good at all. So many other options available in the market

  Hello,Phone got delivered few days earlier than mentioned date in Amazon.Phone is fabulous and not much weight to carry and handle it. I have compared other phones as well with same price however this phone worthy than others.Few advantages for this M31s model.Camera clarity is awesome.Battery charging is super fast and I checked almost 2 days it's holding the charge.You will feel the Touch sensitivity is so cool.Gaming, I used to play Pubg for 3-4 hours however I don't feel any heat problem.Final one which is new Side finger sensor which gives you new experience and easy to use.

  Good amount of research was done before buying this phone. Similar phone has already been there in the family for some time now.So updrading to 8GB, 128GB, format phone with good amount of battery back-up and quality of camera with nice set of features was a good decision.The phone is really a wonderful choice.

  Samsung is finally giving some tough competition to its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi, Realme, etc. Samsung M31s is another card by Samsung to mark its presence in the budget segment having Super AMOLED Display which is the specialty of Samsung. Also, the phone is actually having some good specs like 64 MP Rear and 32 MP front,huge 6000 mAh battery fast and reverse charging option..Back panel of the phone has a nice finish with black and blue shades. Definitely you will love camera of this mobile.Pros:1. A Great Display2. Nice camera setup3. Large battery4. 3.5mm Headphone Jack5. Looks great in hand

  Simply amazing. liked the camera quality and battery life. The 25 watt charger helps for a quick charge. The camera feature single take is a very good feature. In first I was doubtful about the exynos 9611 processor but after testing the phone I'm fully satisfied. My one complaint with this is the accessories offered with the device. Paying around 19499 I feel I can atleast get a TPU case or a wired earphones with the device. Other than that the device itself is very nice with a side fingerprint which works with no flaw.

  I had been wanting to buy this phone since uts launch. The wide variety of features one gets in this phone and that too at such a reasonably low price is awesome. Its side mounted fingerprint scanner is on the fastest I've seen and its very ergonomical. In terms of battery life, the 6000 mAh battery makes sure that I go through the day on a single charge. Talking about my favourite feature, the camera quality is unparalled. It gives you the features which you would only find in the high end models. All in all, a great buy and completely worth the money.

  I have taken Samsung brand first time and really not satisfied. 6000 mah battery-I don't think so.. Battery back up is not like 6000 mah.Camera is good... But if you are taking 18500 rs then you have to give something. Worst thing is heating problem. If you are playing games or watching movie phone become warm. Face biometric is not working properly. Overall 2rating and last but not least Amazon delivery was not good...it was so late and delivery boy was in so hurry. I forget to take back my sim card from the exchange phone..and Amazon customer care saying that they delivery boy number..you can take new sim..this is really petthatic.

  The Samsung M31s, 6GB/128GB, was delivered before time as usual with Amazon. The phone has premium design at a cost of 18499/-. Battery lasting for more than a day. The camera not used much in my five days of purchase, but tested nice. After all, it is not a China phone. Without 2nd thought, if you can not afford to iPhone, go for it. The back is premium looking plastic, It is good that Samsung has designed with plastic to restrict the cost to 18499. After all, every body goes for a back cover. Only cons, they do not provide a back cover, for which the phone is not used till the cover is applied. Thanks to Amazon for their quick delivery.

  Problems I am facing (there are many others who are facing the same issue) -1. Screen freezes when you unlock phone after automatic phone lock happens. This is very inconsistent.2.

It is very irritating to see problem in your phone which is just 6 days old.Before buying or say trusting me please go and search in the ""Samsung Community"" posts, there you will find many issues related to M31s. I'm trying to save your money guys, take some other brand phone.

  In a whole, M31s is a pretty good choice. Some minor modifications can be done, which I felt :1. Though fingerprint reader is superfast, its convenient for right handed person (& it has to be covered completely, sometimes which need more attempts).  So it can be placed on screen for easy access.2. Having a 6000 MAh battery,  its natural to expect long lasting performance (>1.5 days @normal usage), but somehow it doesn't meet the same.3. Camera is quite good enough.4. Apart from that, Samsung should provide screen guard & backcover along with items in the box, so as to meet customer delight.

Refresh rate atleast 90 hzs would be givenThats it guys....This is my personal opinion after I used 7 days

  Biggest disaster .... Samsung should stop online series phones.... Touch is not working from day 3.... After complaining amazon send technician to look prob ... He also sent the same prob... But not at all good response from Amazon customer care... 6-7 different amazon service providers continues to make promises for exchanging phones from last 6-7 days and then they automatically cancelled the delivery and start procedure of cashback and refunding process.... Such a pathetic behavior at local level and amazon service providers... All should stop buying such costly things online from Amazon ... Hope they will refund the proper money back to us!!!

  It is the best Samsung phone in that price, compared to other A series,M series phones..Pros: best camera, side finger print scanner, best ui, 6.5 inch super amoled display with punch hole camera, long battery, reverse charging, 25 Watt fast charging, single take feature, Dolby Atmos, built qualityCons : Average processor, not very good at gaming, no back case provided in box, no pre-applied screen cover other than gorilla glass 3, fringer prints are marked on back after some days,if  back cover is not used.That's all as far as I know...

  I have bought 'Samsung M31S' (8 GB& 128 GB) on last week. I got my phone one day before as scheduled even if I'm a non-prime customer.I am satisfied with overall features and performance after 3-4 days of usage.*Catchy factors1. Awesome Display2. Stupendous Camera quality& features like 'Single Take'3. Battery (1 and a half+ day)4. Sounds & call quality*Disappointment1. Still its using old processer as in a mid-range price phone.2. No back cover & Screen glass3. Feel the phone is a bit heavy ( I accept its 6000 mah battery)My overall rating is 4 out of 5

What I feel is that if it would have been provided Dolby sound without use of headset, it would be adding more stars to five stars.Overall, I am proud owner of this mobile which fulfills all my aspirations. What add more is Samsung operating system which is more user friendly then its counter parts.

  Pros.- Camera, especially the single shot mode which works brilliantly-Battery is superb. Easily use for 1.5 days with moderate usage-Look, especially the back panel and the camera notch in the front enhances its look.-Display, awesome for watching movies, though phone is a bit big and not that travel friendly if you are looking for a sleek and handy phone.Cons-Processor, which is the same that is used in lower end phones than this. Better processor, preferably snapdragon 630 chipset is expected.All together a great deal if you are looking to buy a non-chinese phone.

  So I received my Samsung Galaxy m31s mobile in the starting of August and I almost spent a month and it is pretty cool ☺️ and nice , display feels great and I love its 🔋 battery life . I almost spend my day with mobile and I hardly charge my phone now, 100% charge is freaking enough for a day in m31s . Camera 📸 is best in my view , it also gives best angle advice and I loved this feature. But it is kinda getting struck now a days I donno why and can't figure if it's apps bug or phone bug . Finally it is a good mobile for any college student but you can't actually play games like pubg for a long time in this mobile 😅

  Nice phone, have come back to Samsung after a gap of two years. Beats iPhone anytime with every feature. Not a big user of camera but still can say really well done on that too. Face unlock works gr8 just that finger sensor placed at on/off button needs some practice as not used to it from previous phones. Non Chinese was an important consideration. 8GB/128GB at this price even beats the competition from OnePlus Nord which comes pricier by 6000/- and is still Chinese All in all a good product to have though have used it for 3 days so far and hope it will run the same.

However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.

  Camera features are very good. Battery lasts for nearly two days for a normal use.  Handy mobile, not too large,  not too big.Though it's not snapdragon it works well.ButAfter a month of use I found lag issues.  While using an app and if we lock our mobile for any reason or if the phone locks itself then if we get back to that app/screen  then we find no response from the phone.  That app or that screen doesn't respond.  If we lock and unlock then only that app or screen responds.Disappointed 😞Samsung has rumors that it will go lag and hangs. That has happened in this mobile also.

  I would appreciate the phone and features assembled in by Samsung. It's very handy in use. Battery life is best of all phones, I have used so far including IPhones and other Android phones. Fingerprint is better than expected. It works very well despite of using less surface of the finger. I prefer this camera than the other chinese phones which will make you look extreme pretty even though you're not. Those phones do so much editing that I don't like.Final say is that I am very happy with the performance and I get peace knowing it that I am not using a Chinese phone. I charge it one time only for a day.

The biometric aka fingerprint reader works absolutely fine ,I haven't found any hinderences yet. Single take feature is awe- inspiring. I yearn to thank Samsung for this mid range, astonishing features blessed smart phone. I am not fond of games so this works completely fine for me but I reckon that  it would work stunning for the gamers too as it has a well-known processor.

  I've been using this phone for almost a month now and I can safely say that there are no issues with this device. The battery lasts for about one and a half days on a single charge. The camera set up is really good too and allows for crisp photos even without proper external lighting. Samsung's super AMOLED display on this device is another plus point. There are no heating issues even after hours of heavy gaming. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product and would suggest anyone who is looking to buy a smartphone in this price range to trust the brand value and go for this one with full confidence.

  very great experience with m31s, having superb camera, excellent display, powerful battery, decent processor for everyday use.on field performance can be surprising when used, it may compet with SD 720g.you won't get disappointed for buying non- gaming processor mobile.but....BUILD quality... worse than expected ... buying in 20k have to have atleast Gorilla Glass 3 in back.finger print sensor works in 7 out of 10 times...need improvement.And Samsung store is like Playstore.....either this or that....why bothand ....and ...... why Knox security unusable..

  Looks: Good colour combination with gradient...gives a premium feel.Photos: Quality photographs in daylight... Photograph in artificial light is also good.Battery: 6000mah battery is really useful since in these days large screen mobiles and heavy usage due to increased online activities tend to use more power.Sensor: Fingerprint sensor is fast enough.Screen: Crisp display with bright and vibrant colour depiction...Processor: The product is new and so far no lag... Multitasking is also quite easily handled by the phone.Overall: Good features in 20k price range.

But good for daily life usage but not excellent. Ok ok for gaming but not good.Conclusion- overpriced for 1k, but if you want Samsung or non Chinese go for it.

    The best non-Chinese smartphone under Rs 20,000
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The Galaxy M31s display is gorgeous. The 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen is perfect for watching movies, editing videos and reading epapers. The display is bright and colourful. Even though the Galaxy M31s display has a 60 Hz refresh rate, I bet there is no other phone in the mid-range and premium mid-premium segment with a better screen. Apps and websites open quickly.  The phone ships with Android 10 along with Samsung’s One UI 2. It’s largely familiar but far from stock experience. It would be nice to see Samsung improving speedy software updates on its mid-range phones though.

  Everything works well. Fingerprint reader is quick. The camera and display are amazing, sAmoled looks great! 6000mAh, with my usage lasts upto 2 days. Even if your phone battery is low (15% or so) and you cant charge it for some reasons, there is a battery saving mode which cuts all the background apps, limits cpu power, brightness, the list of apps that can be used etc which conserves the battery life. I don't game on the phone so I can't say about that, but this phone handles my basic day to day tasks flawlessly. Overall, great purchase, loving it!

When I used it give me a full experience  of other expensive phones like Samsung galaxy  s10 and some others also. Fingerprint reader or sensor is also perfect and senses in fraction of seconds.

  It was a big mistake to buy this phone, Fast charging is just a sham , it takes hours to get charged , overall performance  and experience  in using multiple applications is annoying and disappointing. 4 Cameras are of no use , earlier phone with 48MP was far better then this. The worst part is could not return even after complaining about the performance of the phone as it has only replacement clause. So basically it is imposed on me now have to keep it ,have no choice, so beware before buying. :(

But I'm yet to get those ""2 days of battery life"" claims.Update:The battery is not living up to the 6000mAh mark. It's more like a 4000mAh battery with just over a day of power under normal usage.

Camera quality is amazing. Despite using number of social media apps, general day today apps, gaming throughout the day costs only 50-70% of battery in a day. Also includes number of customization options. Phone feels little heavy due to its large battery size. Disappointed for not even providing screenguard and back case.

  An excellent purchase from amazon. Even though the product was received two weeks after ordering, the set is good. Fingerprint sensor is fast and senses every finger even when holdong the phone. Face recognition was not that great on the first days. But now seems better after two weeks of usage. Battery is ok as it drains in one and half day of regular usage. Camera quality is really cool but the night mode is as usual not up to mark similar to all other mobile phones. But very happy with the purchase and would recommend to others.

  A Samsung's best and beast in this price range. Can't think of any other phone now, Camera quality is epic, even the night shots are epic. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensoe are moderately good. If you're looking for gaming, HDR in pubg runs without lag and battery life is legendary for this phone, I charge only once in 24-30 hours. The only con, I'll say is the sceeen size is good in length but width is less, making pictures ratio uncomfortable for instagram or other social medias. But it's worth it.

Loving the display and sound as this phone has Dolby Atmos support for watching movies in Amazon prime video and hotstar. Picture quality is amazing. For regular users like me(considering mentioned above points) this phone is the Best In class in the Market at this price.

  I've used mobiles from various brands. Apart from the new intelli camera feature, I don't find anything attractive. Number wise battery might sound great but it is equivalent to 4000mah of Redmi. Nothing great about this product. I bought it to get rid of a Chinese brand I was using. If I compare it with it, it has better screen and vivid colours. Looks premium and feels light on the hand. M series is introduced to exploit Indian market and this product is specifically launched for Indians. Price is definitely on the higher side.

    Regretting switching back to Samsung
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have been a budget phone user for a brief time now. After hearing a lot about this phone, I decided to get and was shocked at first when I looked at its build quality. Although, don't let the looks fool you. The camera on this one is not as good as it is on other phones in this segment. The portrait performance isn't good at all. It fails to understand the basic edges and curves of each object. The worst part is heating, after a 5 minutes of talking, or a 10 min youtube video, it got extremely heated and I had to keep it aside cause we all know what tends to happen when a samsung phone battery heats up.

  Excellent touch sensors - : Very pleasant to the touch, responsive. Everything suits the filling. Very handy fingerprint scanner with the side button!Excellent battery life -: The battery is a huge plus for me personally. One day it was run 22 Hrs countionously for internet calls. It fully charged within 100 minutes with Bundled fast charger.Crisp AMOLED display -: just awesome display and best quality screen design.Camera -: The camera takes amazing photos, and that's what I really cared about and there is no comparison this year's M 31s beats all phones in this range.

  For this price range, its a very good product. Camera is good. Daylight photography is awesome.  The low light pictures are mediocre. The side fingerprint is fast. Display and screen sensivity is good even after applying a screenguard. The one ui os is clean and user-friendly. Battery life is good.There is some heating issue specially after using the camera and playing games. Lastly Samsung could have provided a faster processor. I have experienced some lag while playing games at higher resolution.Overall its a good product you can buy at this price range and from a premium band like Samsung.

  I have switched from iPhone to Samsung and I must say the features are interested in this phone. Anything you talk about like battery is 6000 mAH that last whole day even you use it whole day. The side lock is good concept and working fine as I pick the phone it gets unlocked. The s amoled display catches your eyes. And the camera have new AI features with 64 mp main camera. Samsung is providing 6 gb ram and 128 gb ram in this price. The only cons is the processor is exynos 9611 whose rating is less as compared to SD 730 provided in M51. But who cares now PUBG is already banned 😅 .overall phone is good.

  M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed . the Camera I have never seen this depth, clarity and saturated color photos in any M series so far. SPEAKER has a bass touch in it equaling a Stereo speaker enough for price paid. Its Knox protected mobile like A series. Also, Thanks for the rapid Delivery and Amazon packing was secure. A well justified price for the M31s. will love M31s liquid LPDDR4x RAM speed & a massive 6000mAh with a INTELLI CAMERA, Samsung has really improved the camera segment in M31s. Finally a bang for hard earned bucks.

  Screen is super awesome. Battery is excellent. Has a premium look and feel. Customisation options are good. Not having stock android OS, it does come preloaded with a lot of unnecessary apps, but most of them can be uninstalled. What disappointed me was the camera quality which was not upto the mark or not as expected. Camera works fine outdoors in daylight but fails miserably in indoors even with ample lighting. Same goes with all modes including Macro. Comparatively poor portrait mode, Pathetic slow-mo, image pixelated (in indoors) and poor image stabilization.

Camera quality is great and provides with a lot of capture modes which provides better photo even at the lowest light.Phone quality for calls is good the battery or phone does not heat while in a call which lasts for more than an hour.  The phone is little heavier because of the high battery provided by the company for a longer life.At the end  a good phone for the budget provided and does deliver what is promised by the manufacturer

The only thing is that it is Gorilla Glass 3 (which is good as it doesn't have any marks of my long nails) but I still think samsung could have easily provided Gorilla Glass 5 and saved us a hassle of finding a good tempered glass that covers its front cam.Except that its a great product.

The top highlights of this phone is its Battery, Camera, super amoled screen, and over all designs(i bought it in mirage black colour).Only area where i think Samsung should update is with its processor. Exynos 9611 is good processor but it cannot beat the competition with snapdragon processors. But overall the company's one UI 2.1 is very optimized and stable so you will not face any lag.Thats all about my experience with this phone.Thankyou.

It's 64MP Quad Camera with Single Take in the most interesting feature of this set. Super AMOLED Infinity-O Display, gives you the magic while matching movies and videos and adding to it 6000 mAh Battery, 25W in-box Fast Charger and reverse charging option, so technically you can use it as a powerbank also.

  Fingerprint unlock option is little bit slow  recently i used  rear Fingerprints phone but after both of  used  i realized  its slow then  rear  Fingerprint and it take time to unlock.Little bit hanging after used 20 days.and mostly I want to tell you it's reverse  charging  it's no working when I want to charge to my.another phone it's showing charging  and disconnecting in every second  after chosen  charge another  device from setting. But it's not Charger another device. So finally  as per my opinion its should be less price than the price(as per phone).

  M31s makes different itself by not only precious looks but amazing features in middle price segment like as playing with display and processor.  its battery performance, many useful features in camera, clear images & video stability which being comes in higher range of phones. it's really great deal in this price. I'm happy for its powerful performance, no complain and must buy😊

  The phones Excellent. Little bit overpriced,but once u start using it , it's worth it. Camera is awesome and features are really cool. Battery though isn't as much as expected. It serves if continued using social media and videos serves about just 24hrs. The phones bit bulky but got a good grip. Definitely not so user friendly for left handers, which is me. But with time u can come in terms with it.Sound quality is awesome, and the phone style is really sassy.Overall is a great mobile, I would give it 4.7

  This product is very satisfying, it has everything an average person require in daily life..specially the camera quality  is the best here and the monster battery..it runs almost 2 days in one go after charging once..overall i really liked the product.....but the only thing is that it is given in the phone info. About knox version it is having but on the other hand there is nowhere the secure folder in this phone..

    Average phone. Needed work on camera, fingerprint sensor
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The product is average. It could have been better. The camera is of average quality I found it not at paar. The camera of A20 is better than this one. The fingerprint sensor takes time to be adjusted and recognize.At this price we expected more from Samsung if it is to give competition to it's Chinese rival Xiaomi or Oppo or vivo.

  Samsung has tried to repeat the same formula with the Galaxy m31s though it had the option to offer and update but the company chose not to. Though  the updated chipset comes with Samsung m51. M31s device does perform satisfactorily repeating the same chipset in all the devices could be a bummerM 31 S does have a good battery life smart fingerprint sensor, loved the design, Amoled display is fab, single take feature is awesome and camera performance is decent under range 20000. I have compared a lot of devices and trust me the camera Samsung is providing is the best features

    Best Phone by Samsung in M series yet. You won't regret buying it.

  The Galaxy M31s is a fantastic value-for-money proposition, and the it makes things even better by offering support for 25W super fast charging to go along with the big battery, a versatile camera setup with the neat Single Take mode, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. The Infinity-O Super AMOLED display is also excellent, and while the camera quality tends to be not-so-great at night, you can now get around that by using the full-fledged Pro mode.In short, if you have the budget, you can’t go wrong with the Galaxy M31s. Go buy it.

  The battery life is good. The phone doesn't lag because of 8gb ram. Camera quality is superb, suitable for people who prefer mobile photography. Features are great, palm ss is cool. Fingerprint reader works well 95% of the time when used. One clear mobile cover could be added though.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000W battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well)Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say

  Placement of Fingerprint reader is not convenient to use, batery life is poor, barely lasts one day. Camera output is just average. Build quality is good but size is too big for single hand operation. Just being sold on brand name otherwise overall an average phone.
