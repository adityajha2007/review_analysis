    Bad bad camera
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.

    The original segment of One Plus
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.

  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.‚Ä¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatüòÖ‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.‚Ä¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here‚úåÔ∏è*UPDATED*‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)

Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it.

  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don‚Äôt panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don‚Äôt  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.

  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.

Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive.

  I have nothing to say about this product but marketing strategy. While pre-ordering this product there was no hdfc bank creditcard offer so I have to purchase it by paying full amount.

This is not at all fair to the customer who pre-ordered this product. And OnePlus and Amazon is just breaking their trust.

  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks

  First of all I wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as I want to gift it to my sister.Oneplus is a no match in this range.  You should go for this without any doubt.Except poor camera quality eveything is superb. Snapdragon 765G is fast and 90Hz display is superb. I am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported.One more low point is that it does not feel  premium as its side is made of plastic.Go for it without any second thought.I will edit my review after some days of use.

I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.

  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY.

    Amazing beast from OnePlus!!!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!

    OnePlus Nord Issue List & Deficiency list. 24 total issues . Think before you buy OnePlus Nord..
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Issue list:1. During phone call screen get locked and you have to unlock again to do anything like disconnect call.2. After every call you will get notification of phone getting updated.3. Battery drain drastically. From 100% to 90% in 7 mins. (Not using any heavy apps. By just screen on).4. Heating issues. Heats for just using messages, what's up and phone calls too. While charging it heats upto 45¬∞ C. So battery is going to get damaged very very soon.5. Call logs missing. Last week call logs are also missing.6. Bluetooth disconnect issues with headphones,buds,health tracker watches or any other Bluetooth devices. Quite embarrassing.7. YouTube videos stuck halfway,not because of internet. That means video(visual stuck) and voice goes on. Like old TVs.8. Wifi speed is low. Laptop shows 40 speed and Nord speed is 18 speed. Other mobile shows 38 speed.9. Messages will be delivered late. OTP get received after few hours sometime.10. Only few apps are permitted to have parallel apps. Mostly very generic. But if you need any specific app you can't.11. Charger and red cable type C pin also  heats up high during charging.12. Camera do not open sometimes.13. You have to Click and wait for photo to be captured without blur both front and back cameras.14. Even if you do point 13. Still photos are not upto mark and night photos not atall upto mark.15. OnePlus Nord is not tested mobile in Market. OnePlus don't agree but if it is tested then why there are so many issues.Deficiency list:1. No 3.5mm Jack.2. Display tint issues. 90% devices have it.3. No external memory slot.4. No infrared to use as a remote of your TV and music system,smart light at home.5. OnePlus Oxygen OS Contacts and Phone dialer apk is missing. And Google contacts and dialer has lot of issues and they are not stable.6. OnePlus Oxygen OS message apk is missing.7. Oxygen OS phone contacts, dialer and messages apks are actually signature of Oxygen OS without which Oxygen OS is clearly incomplete like half meal.8. Plastic body.9. No Automatic call recording. Big deficiency.When talked to OnePlus they gave 100 reasons for deficiencies on this OnePlus Nord. No reason is sounds satisfactory. Mostly every reason OnePlus gave is silly excuse.This is a consolidated list. If you see anything missing please add in comments.All my issues I have raised with OnePlus bit nothing turned out to be resolved.Visited  OnePlus services center nothing resolved. Discussed  with OnePlus customer care, feedbacks given complaints given for each issue given to them with logs, screenshot and what all OnePlus has asked for. I have spent many many hours to inform OnePlus about each and every issue of the above mentioned issues.So please don't reply back to me to reach OnePlus team. This post it here because OnePlus did absolutely nothing to resolve these.Dirty truth of the scenario.

    Review after using the mobile for one week
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure.

  Dont fall for oneplus marketing and hype..I recieved a damaged oneplus nord as i unboxed.. back cover was seperated from the frame and there was a black patch on it.. the phone too never switched on..The irony is, oneplus claims on their website""Droped. Shocked. Shook. Sunburned."" ""We take quality seriously"" but their phone was ripped apart inside the box itself. A dead phone in the end. They fooled us! Infact if u research nord also is facing display and bluetooth issues besides inferior construction which i got to know after i had already made a purchase. Guys i am no one to say dont buy oneplus.. u have to be wise enough to take that call.. but all i can say that dont fall into their trap of marketing and hype they create. Be wise and dont be fooled!

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.---------++++------After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi

  So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ...I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit ..I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons .Pros-1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent.2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good.3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone.4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate.5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie.6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone .7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price.Cons.1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865.2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion.3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this.Personal Opinion.Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.If you find this review helpful please consider to like this review

  Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.Update- The bug was fixed on the same day.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.

  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.

  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now! My wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus :-)

  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!

  Phone received today. Bought it for my mother. She seems to like it a lot. Software experience as expected is very smooth. No lags faced. Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad). The battery life is good (2 hrs of video and browsing and loss of ~11% battery) so expect it to last all day for sure.

  Pre-booked on July and got delivered in Aug4. After a day use, felt that 90Hz is added factor those who are watching 1080p movie and high-end gaming. First time charging took lot of time and second time 10mins, 80% charged from 25%.1. Primary reason for purchasing NORD is for camera spec and advertised as ""Copied from Onplus8"",but failed to impress.  I think camera is borrowed from Budget phone, ""DEFINITELY NOT FROM ONEPLUS 8"".Quality is same as Expected sharpness in image. Image is blurred while zooming. Image quality is at par with Redmi Note3.2.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS.3. Felt battery getting drained too fast for normal usage.Hope ONEPLUS is listening all NORD users concern and it will be addressed in OXYGEN OS11.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  First let me clarify this: ""Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media"" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever!Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don't bother with it's presence/absence.Oxyzen OS as always is ‚ù§Ô∏è. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product.Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.Overall impression: Good phone if you get it for 25k (8GB ram variant)

What OnePlus said it delivered. it's snappy and feels fast.The Screen is Great!I got 5:30 SOT day 1 and it charged pretty fast as well (Poweroff - 50mins, Poweron - 60mins)I did a little stress test from my end running multiple heavy applications and running benchmarks as well, it's temperature increased only about 3-4%, quite impressive.UFS 2 is a drag, and the cameras are overhyped, they are good, but not as advertised.Would suggest this phone to anyone coming from a mid-range device and want a flagship-like feel.The closest competitors for this device are -> Pixel 4a and iPhone SE.Lastly, ""Nord is an experience, not just any other mere device you buy"".

  Almost everything you get under 30k price range... Oxygen OS is the best android skin right now... Experiencing it under 30k is a deal breaker...There are other smartphones with Snapdragon 800 series processors under 30k.. but not all of them are bloatware free except OnePlus...Buy this phone if you love to have a nice UI, great display, good camerasAbsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under 30kProvding a headphone jack to type-c  would have been very good

  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)

  I have got severe display issue with green tint on 75% of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side. No matter how good the phone is in other features but it's being a mid range premium phone, at least this issue not expected.I have ordered 2 phones in which 1 phone is completely alright (no display issue) and other has severe. I tried to exchange the product but Amazon is not supporting for the same.EDIT : Thanks to Amazon for processing the return with refund. (Replacement could not be processed as the product is unavailable)

  After using it for several days,I noticed some issues1) Image processing is taking time(more than usual)2) After clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while, otherwise the image will get blurred3) Low light photography is very poor4) Battery is draining faster even in 60Hz refresh rate.5) Sometimes networks drops are there, you'll lost internet connection for seconds and it'll restore after it.But all of these issues can be resolved by update and OnePlus is very concerned about their customers,as they keeps asking for issues in their community page.Buy it if you're not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device.

  USP of 5G but not even running at a level of 3G. I'm so frustrated of this phone. Being everything fast and snappy, if you're restricted on connectivity, all the fun fades away. The network connection is so lost away, its very hard to connect to the internet. Although its faster than the usual 4G but only after its connected. I literally feel of breaking this phone several times a day. This reminds me of very old tech products which used to work only when you slap or hit it hard. Pathetic!

  One of the best in segment. Don't get distracted by the screen tinting issue. It's yhe Amoled property which is nothing to do with the quality of the product and it won't be hamper your day to day usage. You'll barely notice this unless you want to see it. Despite being mono speakey, the sound it much louder. And above all 90hz refresh rate with oxygen OS is a total bliss and no other android will give you this heavenly experience. The battery is draining a little quick but I think it's because of 90hz and maybe battery optimization will be done in future OTA updates. About cameras, macto and depth cameras are useless as it's not the one that you'll use. Otherwise they are good

  It‚Äôs not what every YouTuber is saying. It‚Äôs absolutely not like the magic Oneplus One was. The other two siblings of OnePlus Nord I have used as my secondary devices were Oneplus C and Oneplus 3T and both were amazing devices and are still with me. NORD is light weight good looking phone with ordinary AMOLED Screen and speaker.  I am not a gamer so it doesn‚Äôt matter how it performs there. No complaints from camera either but nothing great about it too. I also made a mistake of buying it in blue color. It‚Äôs so jarring that it started irritating me in a day. Another blunder- I started using blue sandstone case and I felt like throwing up. Now it‚Äôs in black color sandstone case and looks okay. So I suggest buy its black/grey color. There is no option of returning it unfortunately. And if you are coming from iPhone don‚Äôt even go close to it. You will hate it the way I do.

  Search, compare, compare, and compare again to all its competitors. Nord will stand out always. You need to understand that this is an upper midrange flagship and not a complete premium phone. Unless you are Rahul Gandhi, you should be able to understand that you cannot expect a complete premium experience but Nord gets you as close as possible to it in terms of features, build, display, and after-sales support. So, without thinking twice, go ahead with this. I have been a part of 1+ community for almost 7 years now, and I can definitely say if you are on a tight budget and cannot afford Oneplus 8/8pro, THIS IS THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALWAYS.

    Oxygen OS and display tries to make up for pathetic cameras but fails
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Following is my review of the device -PROS -1. The display is amazing.2. Oxygen OS is really clean, good, and easy to use.3. The Alert Slider button is helpful.4. Charging is fast ( not as much as Realme X2 pro but quite fast)CONS -1. The camera is bad, really bad. Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices.

  I had ordered a OnePlus Nord from Amazon on 6th of August. It was delivered on 8th of August. After using it for a week the display was distorted. I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution. I will never buy a OnePlus device ever again till I exist.

  I ordered OnePlus Nord 12gb ram+ 256gb rom on 6th August morning and it reached to me on 10th August.The display of this phone is excellent, I just loved the movie experience will watching prime video, the colours were really asm.The speaker of this phone, not having a stereo speakers set up, but honestly the speaker is very loudThe camera of this phone:Under artificial lightRear pictures with both ultra wide and main camera are descent enough but the selfies lack detailing.Videos with rear main camera is good but not with ultra wide, it is just average and videos with front camera are just asm.Natural lightVideos and pictures with both cameras are really very good and has a good dynamic rangeThe nightscape and macro mode/camera are just waste, the main camera performs better than nightscape and macro cameraA suggestion that better use g cam for front camera and nightscape mode, pictures with g cam with front and nightscape are better than stock cameraThe pre-appplied screen protector has a descent quality and the back case quality is good.The charging speeds are excellent, I got 0-100 in 1 hr and about 0-65 in 30 mins.I just played coc and not pubg or cod or freefire on it, so don't know the about how the gaming performance, but I think it will have a descent gaming performance.The oxygen os is just smooth and I had a good experience with itThe connectivity with my tws is excellent, but just facing problem when I first connect it, automatically Amazon music starts playing the last played song by me, don't know what's the problem, hope OnePlus fixes it with update.There is know ipx rating, but u will not face any problem with minor issues and the bulid quality is nice, doesn't look that much premium as I expected.The weight of the phone is very less and it is easy to use it with one hand.I didn't faced any issue will calling, the inbulit microphone is nice.The 90 Hertz display is good.And yes, it has green tinting issue but u can only see it at minimum brightness while seeing something in dark mode type and in a dark room, it is not that much greenish type, honestly it's very very much light coloured (green), I just tested the screen, but I didn't saw tinting issues in normal usage, I think the the tinting issue is just negligible for u to buy it.All the things are good except some camera modes, and hope OnePlus would fix it with an update, till then u can use G Cam + Stock cam.All the above it's a very good balanced phone having all the needy features with a good quality at low quality and plus it is a 5G phone.If u want a good and balanced phone under 25k to 30k, OnePlus nord is the best, do not even look at the other brands like redmi, realme,etc.And if u want a phone where ur main prefrence is only and only gaming then OnePlus nord is not for u, checkout the other high performance phones with 800 series chip.Overall the OnePlus Nord is a very good phone with all the best features u want and a descent gaming experience.And it is a value for money smartphone!And I ordered the blue marble colour, which I just liked the most and the design of the phone is also good.

  Really good looking phone which feels premium in hand (exept the sides which are made of plastic)Camera is awesome. Don't look the reviews, their standards are way high. For an average user, you will definately get a flagship level experience.Performance awesome.Display is beutiful to look at.The best thing about this phone is you feel good while writing something,the touch response is top-tier.You will definately get phones much cheaper than this with better spec sheet but let me tell you, having a oneplus phones feels good, buying a mi or oppo phone of 50000 will still be mi and oppo phones as they are known for their cheap phones.And OnePlus phones last and I mean they last long. I previously had OnePlus X(5 years old) and it still works fine exept for battery. Hence you can easily use this phone for atleast for 5 years. That for me is good enough.

  A lot of people have given their expert opinions here so I'm just gonna address a few things.1)Display:- Yes there is a tint issue but I feel Oxygen Os 10.5.7.AC01DA has solved it to an extent.My recommended setting isDisplay calibration>Advanced>Display P3 and tone it down to cold.2)Camera:- I seriously don't know why people are soooo critical about the cameras. I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great. It's mainly due to that 90hz refresh rate.P.S:-Not attaching any photos there are enough of them here üòÇ

  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.

    An honest an Fair review after using it for a while.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-‚Ä¢OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.‚Ä¢The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.‚Ä¢The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)‚Ä¢The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)‚Ä¢The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.‚Ä¢The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-‚Ä¢The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.‚Ä¢After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone

  Oneplus created the hype and asked people to prebook it. I prebooked on 18th July and then again on 28th July and received the product on 9th August. I mean then why that prebook drama.After that the phone comes out to be an average phone. They claimed that it has flagship level camera, trust me 10k phones click better photos.

    Awesome processor power, Touch feel and Front Camera Quality
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models.

  ¬†Loved the size and weight of the phone. The metallic finish and slim body makes it feel top of the world, for such a budget phone packed with multiple features that i shall be exploring on the go. The back cover is quite decent but okay but the most important fact is it has a waterproof protection over the charging point, which is the best part from a usability aspect. Above all the picture quality is very natural and most importantly just like iPhone without any additional filters that takes away the charm. Other than than that it is paacked with multiple camera features, that'll blow your mind.Most importantly the broad smile and happiness over my daughters face was priceless. What else could a proud dad expect from such a valueable product.

    The OnePlus Nord is a truly balanced premium mid ranger that was ever created.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Okay. So, firstly, horrible delivery by Amazon india. I placed the order on 30th July. It got shipped on 12th August and was delivered by 16th. This review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v15 pro beforehand.Like all of you, I also believed that Nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers. But, trust me, this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device. (Not joking, it's beautiful). Obviously if you come from a device like OnePlus 6,7,8 it's a downgrade, no doubt. I wanted to buy the 7t for it's features and processor, but I bought the Nord. Why ?1) 10k cheaper than 7t.2) Better selfie camera composition.3) Same bloatware free oxygenOS.4) 90Hz fluid AMOLED display. (trust me guys, it's buttery smooth. I found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the 90Hz panel. You will get addicted to the display).5) sd 765g : Day to day tasks like swiping , moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium OnePlus devices. (I compared the swiping speeds with 7t pro, it could catch up with the 7t pro). I'm not a heavy gamer. I usually keep my gaming sessions short like for 10 mins at a stretch and I'm done. I noticed zero frame drops playing COD, it ran very smooth. No lags.5) Build quality : I don't know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame. I used an unibody cheap plastic built v15 pro and coming from that, the NORD felt VERY premium in my hands. It is really compact, inhand feel is awesome. You can feel it's a premium device when you hold it. Stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it's plastic frame. We wouldn't even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by OnePlus.6) User interface: Coming from a trash funtouchOS, the oxygenOS is heavenly. It runs apps very smoothly and really fast. No complaints.7) I don't know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful. It helps.8) Super linear bottom firing mono speaker: The speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v15 pro. Yes, it's definitely not loud as the 7t /8/7t pro. But it's loud enough. Would not complain.Here's what I do miss tho:-1) I really miss the headphone jack. I don't have money to buy TWS rn. So I do, dearly miss the headphone jack.2) I expected ufs 3.0 storage. But 2.1 is okay, you wouldn't notice if you aren't that nitpicky.3) The camera quality I would say , for an all-arounder star device like the Nord, it's okayish. It gives you really good day light pictures with decent details. It won't disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned. The pictures look natural, not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones. The ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won't really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details. I could get very good(if not the best) portrait shots and the macro camera, well it's useless. Don't use it. Overall, I know OnePlus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates.4) unpopular opinion : Even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market, I would prefer oxygenOS rather than choosing any of the realme, miuis,etc .

Ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software (or hardware?) and to solve this temporarily, i am now switching on/off airplane mode every now an then. Annoying!!!

  I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media.  The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just  mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.Felt so damn cheated.To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it.

    Beware of Fanboys üò° 'Must Read'
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day.

  Review after 3 months of usage. Pre-ordered the phone coz had a feeling that this was going to be that good.It has totally overcome the expectations in screen and performance. It gives everything that you'll need in a daily driver phone and some moreThese are the bad things that I noticed about this phone -1. Mono speaker(loud) but it's mono.2. Felt like battery was an issue but it's improving with software updates. Now it's nearly 7 hrs of SOT.3. Whoever thinks it's camera is bad, well they should just goto xda and try Google camera port for this. It's still bad(lol).4. Whoever is complaining about green tint are just looking for a reason not to buy this phone coz honest to god, it's not visible normally. You must really be looking for it and must have a nord phone with the defect to actually see it. My nord doesn't have( well I haven't seen it anyways).5. I know some people are fond of inbuilt phone recording in dialer. Sadly nord doesn't have it.Overall I think this phone is great. I'm not much of a camera person and therefore dont mind the ok-ok cameras on this. If you dont take too many photos and just wanna use this for daily use. Go for it. I bought it especially for 765 processor as it has inbuilt 5g modem( and because Google pixel 4a's display is 60Hz and just plain bad).

  #Camera Quality is not up to the mark when compared to  previous OnePlus previous models and generates lots of noise.#Bugs were there when I did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of 4K@60 fps and it got resolved once I updated to the latest OS version.#Green & Purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below 30% brightness.#People who prefer 6GB + 64 GB variant must keep in mind that OnePlus Nord does not have an expandable memory slot. So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue.

  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I bought 8gb ram variant.  let's talk about pros ans cons -1. Battery life - battery drains too fast. However it has fast charging as well. But you need to charge your phone very often. For 100% battery it last up to 7 hours on screen. That's pretty low when you are into phone all time2. Front camera - picture quality is average. Not that great. Biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast 2-3 seconds. There's a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image. And that's really annoying. Another major drawback poor quality in low light.3. Back/Rear Camera. Picture quality is good, also in dim light.4. Gaming - pubg. It runs smooth with graphics5. Fingerprint. - i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all. Again it takes seconds to response. Arrgghh... annoying when you are in hurry.All over, better go for flagship phone. It is not worth spending money. I feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price.

  Its been more than a month, I am using this phone. And I was one of the happy OnePlus user but last week we have got an update and after the installing the updates, there is very serious network issue.Sometimes, it feels like throwing the phone away my new phone as suddenly you cannot call anyone and your net also stops working.I have written below mail to OnePlus lets see till when we get an update. Until then I dont know how am I going to manage.Hi OnePlus Team,There are a couple of issue that I am facing since the last update, please note these problems were not there before the last update took place.1. Whenever I call anyone, there is a full signal and suddenly after a while it runs out of network and shows an error. Also when on international calls it gets disconnected very often. There is no error in sim card as it works well in other device.2. Even in full network, showing 4G above the network I face loading error. Not only on Google but any app, even on whatsapp it is not able to send a hi and I have to reboot the phone to get it working again.I request you to find a solution to this as OnePlus is a very trusted brand and we as consumers do not expect such major problems from you device.

  Nord is'nt a flagship phone of oneplusDue to the low budget we need to comprises certain things..But in this case nord is a fraud device that sell by oneplusThe image quality of the nord is'nt same as the oneplus 8 , but oneplus claim that the camera and camera sensor of the both device is same , if that was true why we don't getting good quality pictures same as oneplus 8  on nord.The second fraud thing is the 5mp depth sensor camera, the camera is just a gimmick that not doing any part on  the depth sensing it is just a fake camera( marketing strategy)And the final thing is the proximity sensor issue while calling , the screen off time is a bit laggy that compare to other devicesI don't expect this kind of incidents from the reputed company like Oneplus

  I personally feel that this is a very good product in this range. The battery lasts almost for two days with average usage (No Gaming involved). Camera quality is good unless if you want to go and zoom it till the last pixel (Not sure why you want to do that) as the inbuilt camera software tries enhance the image and fails in doing so (Only in case of Full image Zoom). Else the image quality is great at this range. Sound quality is good. Overall its a good product for daily use for everyone.

  Hello,I got this phone on 3rd of August, one day before its official launch, and it has been wonderful experience.Although when I opened the box I did see a bubble on the screen underneath so that took be aback (Its still there).The phone charges in appx 60 mins (With more usage gradually it will increase no doubt abt that). But being a moderate user the battery lasts for about 1.5 days which is quite good.As far as performance is concerned this is phone is much better than Google Pixel 4A or Iphone SE in the same price bracket. Hands down. Apps open up really fast no lagging at all. No heating issues as well till now.

  I am writing this review after 1 day of use. First of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between 65-75 minutes.Camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography.Low light photography is the place we need to improve I believe.Sometimes I think this phone is overpriced but the Oxygen OS experience will remove that thinking from our mind.

  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G.

  Bought this one after seeing the specs online and price looked so good. But it didn't meet my expectations. If you're a frequent user , gamer or does something like plays poker in mobile then 100% this is not the phone for you, the reason I'm saying this because of its battery backup though it claims 4135 battery but it lasts only 4-5 hours of continuous uses after a full charge and worst case is in any activity wheather you're playing games, watching videos, talking it drains the same amount of battery. Ofcourse the fast charger is there but why would someone charge their phone 3 times a day. The could have definitely offer better battery backup. Camera is really average don't expect it to capture shots. The only thing i like about the phone is it's screen. Sound quality is pretty good too. Overall a 3star. I hope they fix the battery issue somehow.

  Got the device after a month of launch. Nord is not as per expectations. Battery life is horrible. I need to charge my device twice a day. No doubt it gets only hour to charge but battery back up is 8-9 hour is hudge disappointing. Camera is not as per OnePlus know for. It is average like mid budget 15-20k device has. Micro camera is just to add numbers. Night mode is also not so great. It has Google dialpad. You can't auto record calls and even if you does after it keep alerting during call: you're call has been recorded.Only good thing is no ads. Oxygen OS.I'll never suggest to invest this much amount for average phone just because of brand name.

Front cam also not soo good, I like the fingrt print point and switch. They could have give option to the user for wired headset, cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours, don't think soo wireless ones will serve purpose.

  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!

  I bought the OnePlus phone first time and I bought12gb 256gb varient of this phone..I like every things on this smartphone like 5g ready, camera, oxygen os, performance is mediocore.The Software of this device is best in the game. I like it because it has the functionality like stock Android and also highly customisable. You can get software updates very quickly and fastly. It's 90hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy.I actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me. It's camera have OIS supported , you can get very good daytime shots with it. And may be mediocore night time shots But not as the level of flagship but this doesn't bother me because with the power of Lightroom I can bring those photos to the another level.The two things I didn't like that it's battery life it could be little bit better and also. It's display have some little tint issue.But that's not a big problem for me.Below are the attached sample shots from this device.

  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. And coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed....

  It's nearly been a month with Nord and on my opinion there's been no issues both the fingerprint and face unlock are fast the phone is so smooth even at 60Hz refresh rate and has a really good battery life. Excellent and smooth gaming performances till now screen recording is great and coming to the oxygen os its super user friendly you'll never need an external application or software to feel satisfied cause Oxygen os is one of the best in the market , camera performance is awesome the primary sensor gives much detailed and saturated images then wide angle lens both in front and back camera is the incredible the major blow would be it's macro sensor in my opinion cause the colours are much softer so if you just want to take best pictures you better buy a basic dslr but in overall performance the camera is pretty great, the phone is so slippery without a case so better use it and fast charging really saves you a lot of time, the alert slider is so usefull in short if you are looking for a smartphone in a mid range budget with cool user experience Nord is the best in my opinion but if you expect a high performance machine and ready to make some sacrifices like oxygen os,alert slider etc you have a lot of other options so choose wisely ü§ûüíï

  Hi I'm using 12/256gn variant since 1 month+. Don't waste your money!Cons:1. Bluetooth issue even after few updates.2. Getting location icon in status-bar even after location is turned off. It's a serious issue. every time I need to restart my phone to fix this issue.3. Phone gets heat if u use it while charging.4. After using the phone for few days (may be within 15 days) you will fell the lag in screen sensitivity (even if we run it in 90hz) 5. Call connectivity issue if u r using internet calling option. even though if your network is full and internet speed is in mbps your call quality will be worst.6. Battery discharges easily.7. Few gestures are not working properly after update. (might be because of software issue)8. In 4 rear camera last 2 are utterly waste even after updates.9. Finger-print reader is good but sometimes it lags to open.Conclusion:If you are thinking that you struggled a lot to earn money and if you know the importance and value money then don't go for it. If not its left to you (if you think you got money from somewhere and somehow without any effort and if you feel 30k is just nothing)I'm feeling about myself that i would have use this money to buy some other phone might be samsung A71 or apple's iPhone SE 2020.

  This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star.

    A delightful device, held back by quality control
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it.

  The phone got delivered today, it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder. I bought this phone for my father and playing around with it I guess this would be the best option for him. He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks. Macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of.NOTE: Heavy Gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term.Thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion, a good strategy must say.

  Too many bugs in the software. Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!

The Night Mode works like magic!Speakers: Mono, but really loud. They have SW optimizations that add the stereo effect in earphones.Build Quality: 9.5/10Don't compare a 30k phone with flagship phones. But, I haved used my friends OnePlus 8 Pro and my Nord together. I didn't notice any difference at all. The 90Hz AMOLED Display does the magic (so smooth). Only when playing PubG in the highest settings, the 8Pro outperformed. Otherwise, there is no noticeable issue. Also, when it comes to the camera, yes the 2MP sensors are crap. The main sensors cover up for those 2MP sensors. Trust me. OnePlus tweaks the software from time to time. After using, you won't feel like it's a 2MP sensor, the macro images come so good with the main sensors. But again, don't compare the Nord with flagship phones. Still, you would hardly find anything to complain about. It would literally need a lot of struggle to find flaws in it. It's everything you could ask for, at a pretty great price.

  The front camera is pathetic, blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures, its not worth giving 28k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone. For front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad, sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality. i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it, or they just want to bluff the customer by name......... u can get more good camera phone in this rangeRear camera is good, macro is pathetic its like vga camera, in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality, you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos.Battery drains too quicklySoftware is good

  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry.

  An awesome phone for the price. Simply great. The camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos. If you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto 30k go for it. No other brand gives you a 12|256 variant for this price. The phone is awesome. You wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using.

  The phone has severe network issues and loses network very frequently. Call drops and Network unavailable most of the time. This is not an operator issue as I'm at home only in lockdown and get proper signal in other phones in the house.Secondly, even if you manage to get network, the phone has a very bad heating problem. Within 5-10 minutes of voice call the phone heats up badly and becomes unusable. You have to wait for it to cool before being able to use again.Lastly, the battery drain is too bad. Morning 8am at 100% gets to single digit by 5pm with average usage. If I try to watch videos/game then it goes down faster, but you don't have to worry about it as within 15 minutes of watching video/gaming the phone will heat up and give you a notification that some functions have been disabled to reduce temperature. So you don't worry about watching video or gaming for long.Overall too many bugs which are not resolved. Wouldn't recommend to anyone..

  what happened to oneplus. It used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x. now we no longer can trust specs on paper.selfie camera is one of the worst ever. blurry pixelated images. 3 yrs old phone models in this range have better camera. even making calls have issues with this phone. there are bugs everywhere.very poor quality in ever aspect. total waste of money. they have to understand, they cant please everyone. End of the quality matters and there should be value for money spent and specs needs to be up to the industry standard. just saying 32 MP is not enough, if it performs equivalent to 5MP.this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money.

  Its been one month approx of purchasing this device in which OnePlus has given 5 updates so here is my review after one month usage and on latest update1) the mobile is full of bugs, it looks like oneplus team didn't tested it before launching . A lot of bugs like camera crashing, photos not showing in gallery ,overheating after only 25min streaming,night mode error . already shared logs with the OnePlus team no fix as of now even after 5 updates still the same problems2)  on an average only 5 hours of screen on time, doesn't look like 4000mah battery have to charge twice during a day ,my older redmi Mobile was giving better SOT than this3)  network drops issue most often chrome shows blank page have to reload 3-4 times to show the page content4) the oxygen os is good smooth as silk5) camera performance is average6) amoled display surely surpasses lcd ,great colors diversification Conclusion- being new member to OnePlus community i expected premium services didn't expect such a buggy deviceUpdate- its been more than 2months of using it the problem has worsened the mobile heats like a heating rod even on a normal browsing for 10-15 minutes . Myb earlier mi mobile was better than it i do not have words to describe all the issue i am facing . Already shared the logs with oneplus team still no response . I will say only one thing if the return window wasnt. Closed i might have returned it . Its just a waste of money even a ki ,realme mobile at this price segment will be a great choice

  First of all I'm writing this review after 3-4 days of use. 1.The display is indeed a bliss to look at. You may not notice it at first. But you'll see other phones in slow motion when you use other phones.2.The warp charging is amazing. Gets your phone filled in under an hour.3.The primary camera is nice and captures details but it lacks the natural colour reproduction at times and the dynamic range needs to be better.(the camera of the redmi k20 pro is slightly better in terms of the color reproduction) and iphone xr camera still is better4.The macro camera is bullshit and need updates right away.5. Wide angle lens is okay, just okay.needs betterment. And could be better.6.The selfie camera is fine but no iphone camera , the wide angle selfie isn't that nice7.the build quality is firm,nice and of nice built but stands a tad bit lower from the redmi k20 pro ,maybe because of the metal frame vs plastic in Nord.8.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is damn fast.9. The battery lasts for a day under moderate use. Not more than a day for sure.10.Oxygen OS ! Wow . Just smooth, fast and a bliss !

The only one I which i noticed is that Rear camera quality isn't that great compared to Oneplus 8 like they are claiming. But they are good in Ample lighting conditions. Only when it comes to Indoor and low light they struggle a bit.Verdict- Go for it. It's a perfectely well balanced phone covering every aspects. The beauty of OXYGEN OS and Brand Recognition of ONE PLUS are something that you can't ignore.

  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don‚Äôt mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You‚Äôd be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback... So if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than 30k then just go for it

I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won‚Äôt notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements

Don't get fooled by  any YouTube videos!Color - 4.5/5 It's bold and colorfull..Fingerprint - 4/5 works really fast!Overall - 2.5/5 Expected more then wat received and the expectations were set by the OnePlus Ads..To all oneplus premium users or New buyers this phone is not for you, please go by the specs not by company's name! From my experience , OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 6T is way better then Nord! So I suggest you to go for OnePlus 7T/Realme X2 pro..I ll add/update after a month if changes found üëç

  After one day usage, I can say this is a very good mid range phone.Pros: smooth OS, Amoled screen quality is very good, no screen tint issues.No bloatware apps like other Chinese phones.Selfie camera is goodGood build quality.Face unlock is very fast.There are 6-10 tips and tricks available in Oxygen OS which is very useful in daily usage.Cons:Rear camera does decent job, not meeting the expectation set by OnePlus.Battery drains fast whenever refresh rate is set to 90Hz.On screen fingerprint scanner is not quick compared to rear scanner.Headphone jack is not a problem for me, I am using bluetooth earbuds. Also there are type c to 3.5mm converter available in the market in 200rupees.This Mobile is  very good choice for daily normal usage. Not recommended for heavy usage.

    Issue with network and phone auto restarts

  This is really not as per oneplus standards.1. The phone restarts randomly every now and then.2. The network coverage is very bad. Often people tell me your phone is not reachable but when i see the network bar it shows no issue.3. Problem with jio network. In my area jio coverage is very good but this phone often shows no jio network. I need keep switching flight mode to regain the network.These r two main issue with the phone and no body is writing about it. (Network and restarting)

    Overall a very good phone by OnePlus in this segment.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good, though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from 0 to 100% in over an hour (depending on the voltage you receive ). Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update.

    Awesome phone with some fixable flaws!
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is one of the best phones from OnePlus buf with some fixable flaws. I'm using a 12GB RAM variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os's ram management. Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly. Everyone is saying battery is great but I didn't get more than 5hours of sot that too without gaming. Final call is yours, cheers!P.s. you can not uninstall the pre-installed Netflix app.

  Positive:1. Good display and touch (Pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience)2. Decent sound on both speaker and earphones3. Main camera (48MP) is good4. Brilliant RAM management, No lag observed in normal usage5. Satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly6. No heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging7. Finger print and face unlock works perfectly8. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard9. Blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great. In hand feeling is good.10. The clean and add free UI of the oxigen OS will make it way different from other android phone of this budget11. Back cover is really good. No complain on the pre-applied screen guard12. Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI

    ""Nord"" A good phone under 30k segment
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Oneplus Nord... I have been using this phone since 10 August 2020 and now it's a 15 days of usage review.This phone got a lot of hypes and I think it's all worth it... If someone planning to go from 15k phone user to under 30k segment this phone is a great one for you.1. So coming to the design aspect this phone is gorgeous, don't confuse yourself by the plastic frame and all use a bumper case.2. Battery life.. Is kind of decent and I won't say it's a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it's pretty decent.3. Camera, here it's the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don't worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can't what's in the screen. Since it's 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn't look soo big and it's handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it's even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It's the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is ""no green tint"" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don't think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Those who wants to buy this phone , he or she should know about cons of this mobile too because no one talks about cons and this mobile have serious issues that might be important to you. The very serious issue is that about BLUETOOTH , it has been 2months since this phone is launched and they haven't done anything about this . The issue is bluetooth doesn't work properly in this and this is annoying because it doesn't have headphone jack that's why we must have bluetooth headphones . Bluetooth automatically disconnects but doesn't connect automatically again , you have to go in the settings and connect it manually.This disconnection happens in every 10-15mins . literally how can they make this phones with many issues ? Atlast if u want to buy it you have to know its cons too.

  I had the OnePlus 3T before I went for the Nord. I had bought the 3T for 35k and bought this 12gb variant for 30k and I have to say, it's a HUGE upgrade for me.People in the reviews keep on commenting about how the camera isn't good, while comparing it to phones outsidebita price range. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, the cameras are excellent! The only phone that may be slightly better in the camera division maybe the Samsung A51 of a similar price range. But then again, the rest of the hardware in the A51 is pretty much garbage.The battery is excellent, touch response is excellent, gaming performance is good, not the best, but good enough (not for high perfomance gaming). I play COD on it on medium graphics and works very very smoothly. The display is just magnificent.If you are looking for a phone within 30k, your search stops here.

  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I got the 12/256 version for 28k because of amex card. Best in this price I would say.Using this phone for more than 10 days now.Almost everything about this phone is best in this price.Processor: Works really well for day to day usage and any of the modern games. It won't lag or anything with 12gb ram.Display: you won't be disappointed at all. The best in this price. Nice amoled display, nice color and everything and 90Hz on top is like the best thing. Super smooth display.Camera: main rear camera is really good captures really good picture and low light photos r also good. Macro cam I don't think is that good, gets the job done. You can additionally use Gcam also if u want.But I Didn't like the selfie camera in low light, idk what the problem is but I guess with update they will fix it. Hopefully.Battery: Nice battery backup I would say. Gives about 7 hours of screen on time with moderate usage (including little gaming).And about charging speed, 0-100% in 55 minutes if you switch off and charge. And if it's on then it takes about 70 min to charge fully.Look and feel: Really looks good, I have the grey color which really suits. Premium glass back feels really light and premium.Speaker- no dual speaker or dolby atmos, but believe me the sound is really loud and clear. Actually better than other dual speaker phones.Cons- No 3.5mm audio jack and plastic frame.Conclusion- If u don't need the audio jack then I think this is the best buy in this price. You get brand value and oxygen OS with soo many other pros. Go with it without a second thought.Happy shopping üòä

Cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue. Though it has 90 hz refresh rate but some times it lags. Need to fix this minor problems.

    Great phone for someone who needs a smooth and flagship like performance from a mid ranged phone
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Overall I'm happy with the way this phone performs. Lets point its features out:- Great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its 90 hz refresh rate, colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty.. side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway.- Performance is great 765G is more than enough for a lite user and by this I don't mean it won't perform if you want to play a few games on it. Works beautifully.- Now the only issue I came across while using this phone was its camera, even though it's being advertised for its bomb camera setup it's really not that special. The camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot. This said I am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before OnePlus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue (well at least I hope they do!!!).So to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that's just poor :'|

  Pathetic Camera, feels like shooting by 5MP camera wayback in 2005.Main camera is atleast useful, rest is just to increase the no of sensors, so that more money should be charged from consumer.Just like OP included WARP charger in box similarly I think, OP fitted WARP discharger in the phone.that's why NORD drains battery like no other phone must be draining. I am not a heavy user or gamer but I need to charge 2 times in a day to keep mobile powered on round the clock. Don't know how and why, people in review says that battery backup is good whereas it is pathetic. Just because OP is providing fast charger, it does not mean that user should always seat next to power supply socket all the time.Above said is my Frank opinion.

  there was a tint on screen along camera module which is visible in low brightness, technician admitted that it was a manufacturing defect but amazon refused to give me a replacement, oneplus customer care suggested me to visit service center for a newly purchased device that is worth 30k. if these things happen in budget phones, it's okay but it's a premium midrange smartphone and that too from a reputed brand. checked oneplus forums and saw lots of users are facing same issue, in my suggestion. don't buy this product because amazon is not going to help you with this product after sale. even oneplus is not going to help you with this, the statement i recieved was that is a characterstic of OLED display, while me being using amoled screens from last 4 years, knows that it's not a characterstic feature but a manufacturing defect. not the brand which stands for quality anymore.

  I bought oneplus Nord last week which was delivered on 14th Aug 2020.  Phone worked well for 1 days and it stopped working on Saturday night.  I found phone is turning off and on within 30 secs on Sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network.  It would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network.  It hangs and turn offs immediately.  I contacted Amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till Wednesday.  A technician will come on Wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not.  Nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early.  I have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product.Very pathetic service and will not recommend to Anyone.

  Overall: 1. Solid phone. great camera2. Buy if you want 5G and have budget for 25-30k. Else you can go for realme/oppo at 10k lower cost.3. Much much better OS than xiomi/redmi. No bloatware. even oneplus app come default disabled!4. I loved the cameras even though online people have said camera is not so good. But again it's hit and miss. Some of the night pics (or those with light in background) i took seemed over-processed and/or pixelated. In such cases change the settings5. Sturidiness is good. But still buy with insurance. Screens once gone never come back!---5G: This is really something I don't think i'll need. i'm happy with 4G for all my needs. This shifting of spectrum is a total money making business. The shift from 3G-4G was necessary, but put unnecessary pressure on telecom players who had invested lakhs of crores on 3G spectrum for 20-30 year leases. That time reliance was the only early one to buy 4G spectrum at deep discounts (probably knowing before-hand about regime change). Again, I think 5G is a scam to help reliance make money (and 4G spectrum buyers like airtel lose money). I dont see myself needing 5G anytime in near future.Safety: I've broken my oppo 3 months back. Used an older Redmi. Which broke in one fall in 2 months. Used a broken phone for 2 months so this was important to me. This comes with plastic guard and screenguard inbuilt. Plastic guard is larger at corners.Weight: It seems sturdy enough. But lots of online reviews say the phone if mishandled can breakBatteries: Great fast charging! I charge once a day and charge for 30 minutes or so. even a five minute charge lasts for 2-3 hours (of video calling)Speed: I'm not a gamer or anything, but seems fast enough easily for all my needs.Close to Stock Android: I used to go for xiaomi and realme which completely spoil the android experience with their own versions. Might I say the xiaomi version was pure evil. It used to hoist a much of MI apps on me. If i uninstall MI Pay, the next morning, it used to come back, on it's own! Oxygen is such a relief after these. The OS -Muhc Much better than Xiaomi. Marginally better than Oppo and Realme.Build: I liked the build. It comes with its own cover. The cover has extra protection at the corners and has special seal for battery area so water doesn't get in.Camera: Comes with lots of cameras. How do these help? They give  the software a chance to build a composite image, capture more light in a shorter interval and get depth perception easier.Close up camera: I have captured a baby butterfly/moth which was smaller than a fingernail. This was at full zoom. Though i was only holding with hand, there is no blurriness on image. Details have come out adequately. Supposedly i could have done a macro but the camera interface doesn't easily open up all the features. For example I had to fiddle around before i could figure out how to switch on the flash.Nightvision Camera: 3 exhibits for your viewing pleassure. I have done a comparison between the actual photos in the night, and the modified photos as captured by the cameras. As you can see, the captures have completely improved the lighting. I have not captured using tripod for long exposure etc and yet shakiness is not too high. The starkest effect is in the selfie captured where it seems like day! the colors in the modified image are true to actuals. This was very surprising to me!Selfies: Good camera as gets nice depth. Use with google photos to ensure you never run out of space for photos!Color: Blue is my favorite color, and I love the pastel blue of this phone.

  It is better to say it is very good deal right now(i bought when it was launched). It is very balanced phone, not a beast in any specific area. It must it is a phone which most of users want. Moreover, OxygenOs is icing on a cake.You are paying more price because of oxygen os. It will get some price cut.Cameras are above average. Main Camera (primary camera) is pretty good and ultra wide also captures good shots but due it is 8MP lens so details will get lost if you zoomed.Battery is one day. Although, you get 30T warp charger which charges a device 70% in 30 mins.No lags no heating issues no bloatware in software.Yeah, processor has less powerful as compared to 800 series processor but it easily done tasks as 845 do.

    Utterly disappointing!!!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  ‚ÄåOnePlus had always come across as a company that delivered on its promises to customers. But sadly, the Nord marks their deviation from this customer-centric philosophy. They have stooped to the level of mediocre companies making empty claims about their products! Nord is utterly disappointing, its cameras (claimed to be on par with OP 8 series) is worse than ones found in below 15k phones ,  monospeaker gives tough competition to those in cheapest phones ,  display has pink tinting issue, battery drains in no time, all in all it points to use of substandard hardware all round which makes this phone not worth even 15k!!  OnePlus also seems to have bought out all the top reviewers so that they can effectively mislead prospective buyers.

  It is not a flagship if you want that experience. It is a really good midrange experience coming from one of the better brands. You can certainly get more value for money from other brands however the quality of software support and customer service from OnePlus is better than all such brands. A must buy especially if you love oxygen os or just want a reliable device to use for 2-3 years .

    Overall the phone is good but my Oneplus 6 still wins over Nord
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  To be very honest, the phone is good. But the kind of hype is being created to sale this phone it's not that worthy. Let me devide in cons and pros -1st of all, the oneplus data transfer app failed to transfer all data from my old Oneplus 6 to this phone.2nd: my Oneplus 6 was of 64 gb and eveen after all files are not being transferred it has used 50% of the Nord memory. I still don't understand the calculation.3rd: 2 front camera was unnecessary, output is okay. I have seen the best ever front camera in Oneplus 7.4th: macro lens is worthless5th: camera view is only 4:3, full screen camera takes only 12 mp photo.6th: camera and video output is okay, not that great.7. Display is a bit of yellowish or over saturated probably because of amoledLet me discuss the Pros-Really fast charge and a day usage consumes only 50% while using for social apps and day to day job. Heavy gaming also do not affect the battery much. Speaker output is good. Call quality is awesome.Overall the phone is good but my Oneplus 6 still wins over Nord.

  Worth the hype.Good phone in this budget segment.Bought the 12gb ram 256 gb on pre order and am satisfied with the performace. Camera takes good photos in natural light and with flash. Selfie camera is also good. Battery life is not that great . Does drain quite quiclky. The finishing looks premium with Corning gorilla glass on the front and the back. Heavy duty games work sufficiently well with a little heating.

  I was so sceptical... believe me. After reading so many reviews about this and that, I was really sacred as to what I'll end up receiving. But thankfully I got a beautifully sealed & secured new phone.As for the device,I like it. It has everything you ""need"". Obviously you can't expect the things you get in a 100k 's phone.The camera is pretty cool, irrespective of what some people say, I find it amusing. I am not a professional photographer but I do love to capture images. (I've attached some for ref)Battery life is awesome. Finger print reader & face unlock is workable.Haptics and other features are great!The built quality is durable. Just be careful with the Sim ejector, I scratched my phone xd.This was truly an upgrade for me. Someone who's coming from an unnamed Brand's smartphone. And yes, no need to buy a cover or screen guard, it comes with it. Easy to set up and a very compact device!

    Stupid phone
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Honestly, feels like a downgrade from my three year old gb ram redmi.  There's no second/private space or similar, you need to add another visible user account. There's a ""hidden space"" but the password for the same cannot be made different from the screen lock password.  No built in document/QR code scanner, you have to use the stupid ""Google lens""  There's no automatic call recorder, there's a call recording option on the dialler, but it will very clearly notify about the recording to the person at the other end.  The camera quality is just about the same as what much cheaper phones provide  Yeah, there's the 12gb ram! But what are you going to use it for? The phone is anyway deemed as not good for heavy gaming.  The OS is claimed to be bloat free, but what good is it if you need to install many utility apps from third parties!  The fast charging feature is probably the only good thing about this phone.

  I have order nord on pre book day. I want to order blue marble 256Gb but it was not available on 28 July. So I compromise and order grey one. My friend order blue marble on 6 August on open sale day and recevied phone on 7 August. Even though I order phone on pre booking day (28july) I received on 8 august. Very disappointing from one plus as they delivered product to open sale customer rather than those customer who has booked phone on pre booking day. I want to get replace it with blue one. I trying to contact Amazon through call but they disable call us option for this product. One plus just created hype for Nord. They didn't provided customer service. There is also issue in bullet z connection.

  A great deal at a given price for a premium product. But the price charged should also meet the standards. Reviewing after 1 month of usage.Few things (important) need to be tweaked by manufacturerBattery drains even if background apps were closed and phone is not in use or locked.Camera is not so great- front camera takes long time to stabilize and capture at full clarity.- groupies cant be handled well with front camCharging takes around 40 mins + to get fully chargedStill some UI issues that really annoy such as no volume or vibration control for notifications-with a notification light it would be somewhat useful (nord doesn't have notification light)it has internet/wifi connectivity issues like sometimes notifications will receive when the phone is unlocked and whatsapp web wont connect properly if the phone is lockedFingerprint:Fingerprint recognition works fine. But when you put it in pocket the pocket mode is not working properly and giving a notification as fingerprint disabled when we use

    Perfect mid ranger by miles!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It's the perfect mid ranger. It's snappy and smooth with 90 hz, display is good albiet a tad low on brightness. Will test with 60z on and update later on. The best thing about the Nord is the OxygenOS. Got an update to version 10.5.5 immediately on starting the phone. The phone is a bit tall and I would have liked a bit more width like Samsung M30s which was was previous phone before this. The warp charge works as promised ... got to 0%-100% in 107 mins after the phone was installed with almost 100 apps, which I thing I was consuming some battery in the background. Haven't tasted camera much except couple of selfies which  turned out perfectly okay in night light, and daylight photography returned decent pictures. About sound quality - music volume is pretty loud for a mono speaker and can get distorted on full volume. Call volume is good but not very load. Phone speaker volume is a bit on low side which I disliked. Marble blue colour shines on day light and night which looks awesome. The phone case provided with the box is good one. Start guide is a joke and not much given in it except placement of various buttons. Will update more since it's been only a day of usage for me.

  I guess today we are in a place where for a given price range, we always have 2-3 best phones.Choosing one phone depends upon the right side of trade off u want to go.Realme X3 SuperZoom, Vivo V19,Realme X2 Pro, Redmi K20 Pro, Oppo Reno 3 Pro.All phones have their own trade offs.One plus nord gives you average experience in every segment be it camera, cpu, memory, battery etc and Oxygen OS. I think oxygen OS and oneplus brand is what it strikes out.If you want to incline towards only camera or only battery or only CPU go for above phones.If you want a premium feel and average value for money exp go for NORD.

  Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.* Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.* 60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that.* The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.* The phone looks and feels premium while using.* Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)i suggest this nord for who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints..

    Best bang for the buck phone from OnePlus right now.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after a week of use . The phone has almost equal number of goods and bads to it . So here goes .Pros:1) Display is very good. And it is not curved. Thank god for that . Excellent colurs and 90hz refresh rate do help. Do not compare to those of the 60k+ flagships ofcourse.  I have observed some issues  with watching c HDR content. Other than that it is very good .2) Narrower and lighter compared to most other phones in this price range or above. Operating it is much easier because of it .3) Very good battery life. Easily last more than a day under heavy usage .4) 30T wrap charge is definitely a plus . Not many phones in this price range can boast of better charging speed than this , except for a few realme phones .5) Gorilla glass 5 protection on front and back. They are usingn the same glass for OnePlus 8 pro too .6) Main camera is good for the price. It is the same one used in OnePlus 8 and 7T/7pro. But the camera software needs some work.Which I am sure OnePlus will do.7) Selfie camera is good too . not sure why we need two Selfie cameras though.Cons:1) That horrendous pill shaped cutout for the selfie cameras are a real eyesore. That also eats into the display area a fair bit and affects the overall usability especially in case of using apps like Netflix.2) Plastic frame instead of a metallic one .3) There is some noticeable shift  in display white balance when it switches between 90 and 60hz, maybe only for my unit .4) Ultra wide and macro cameras are there just to make up the numbers. Especially the 2mp macro one is useless.5) Software still needs some work . I am sure OnePlus will keep updating it and make it better .6) It would have been better if OnePlus had made 3.5 mm jack available at this price range instead of going for the usb c only route .

  For 28k and some exchange I found this product value for money. For 30k I don't think so, reason being camera quality in low light conditions is poor. Marketing on the basis of 4 camera is being done by one Plus but it turns out that macro camera is not good at all.I would definitely say that picture quality in day light conditions is osm. Gaming experience is smooth with no heating issues. Better life n charging speed bith are phenomenon.

  Well people on YouTube said their battery lasted a day long for casual using. I don't think that's true. All I do most of the day is turn on hotspot. The battery goes from 100 to 50s or even 40s by then(9AM to 2PM). But the good thing is it charges back in less than an hour. So on a typical day it has to be charged 1.5 times rather 1 full charge. Also the 90Hz display is excellent. Camera quality is really good for it's range. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. The color(blue marble) is really vibrant and the phone just goes in my hand like it's not a 6.5 inch long one. I am new to the Oxygen OS, bur I can say it's really good. Overall, except for the battery life, it's a great phone.

  A well made product when it comes to build quality. The processor is fairly capable, no slouch at all.Coming from a OnePlus 3 as my previous phone and this feels like a major upgrade, no lags, no stutters and looks great too.The macro camera was sub par but has gotten better with updates,  the rest of the camera array is great.Speaker sounds decent.No network issues so far.Great battery life and charging speed is pretty good.When I'm buying a phone I usually look for being able to use all my apps without issues, a good video and photo camera and a reliable battery.This ticks all those boxes.In fact this has reduced my battery anxiety quite a bit as it lasts and allows for a fair bit of usage and a quick 15 to 20 minutes top-up allows you to keep going for quite a bit.The relative stability of Oxygen OS makes it a reliable daily driver.

  Used it for 5 days by now and not happy with the purchase, not a value for money thing. I am a professional with average usage, no gaming, no video streaming, generalized basic apps, then too the phone drains battery and heating up every usage which is more than of 10 min. Even during audio con calls for 10 min or above it drain battery and heating up.The biggest drawback as I mentioned above but there few more here:1 - Not a great camera phone but I didn't required either, so decide as per your requirement.2 - Feel lagging in apps based on graphics usage.3 - No fast charger with box, but charger is ok.4 - Not an smooth performer and speed of operations keep vairing. Processor is of low capacity.Pros:1 - OnePlus branding.2 - Premium look and good aurgonomics.3 - Display is quite satisfying. But you could get a much better in same cost.4 - Finger print scanner is quick.5 - Sturdy and clean OxyOs.Verdict if you are not bothered about the brand name as I , than never buy this and you could get a far far better phone in brands like Redmi, Vivo or Realme...

  I purchased this one plus nord 5g phone worth Rs 29999.00 through Amazon on 25 th august 2020.This is the  worst phone i have purchased in my life.This phone keeps restarting every now and then.Apps such as netflix and amazon prime doesnt work properly on this phone.You cant even install the system update oneplus nord oxygen OS 10.5.8.AC01 DA even after downloading  2594 MB of system update 5-6 times.It keeps on showing the same error system update installation failure.This phone has been given for repair at the One plus authorised service centre,Vytilla,kerala twice.The first time the service personnel told the issue has been solved in 30mins.After the first repair the time gap between restarting just increased and the other issues also persisted.The second time when this phone  was given or servicing it took 3 days as my phone had to be  ""kept on observation"" as this was a repeated  issue.But still these issues persists.You cant return this phone because as per Amazon's policy even if you buy a phone worth Rs 30K it has to be returned within 7 days.Please note no one expects a brand such a one plus to sell such a low quality product.The warranty card provided by one plus is absolutely useless as you can give your phone for servicing multiple times at the authorized service center multiple times free of cost in case of software issues.You can get a replacement only  if its a hardware issue.I had even purchased Acko 1 year total damage protection for worth Rs 1618.60 for my phone.But whats the use as this plan only covers physical damage and not software issue.Please do note that every time you have to give your phone for repair,you have to erase all the data in your phone, take a backup and put your SIM on some other phone.People put their hard earned money just because they trust that a premium brand such as One plus will never betray customers by making false promise.If this is the scenario,people should go or cheaper brands which value customers money and time and offer better services.Even one plus call center executives can only help customers to give their phone for repair at the authorized service center.,which i am not willing to do in this present situation.Please do provide a replacement for this phone.Looking forward for a new phone without any complaints.

After a few System updates, that fixed it for me even though there was nothing about battery in the change log.Camera is...well not a flagship by any means as they've tried it market it to their fans. If this is what passes for flagship these days, OnePlus is going to have a hard time ahead. Apparently, it's the same module as the OnePlus 8 but the functionality is limited and quality worse even. Although I personally think for a 30k phone, it's okay.I don't play games on my phone but after watching a movie for a few minutes the display does heat up a little. Nothing too serious yet but time will tell. Any heat issues will more or less cause the battery to degrade faster.There's a problem with my phone where sometimes after a fresh boot the phone will not show SIM signal for some reason even though it detects it just fine. Another reboot does fix it all the time but it's minor inconvenience/nuisance that shouldn't be happening.The UI is pretty clean. Don't have many complaints here except for the gaming software bloatware and the lack of a music app. Yes, yes I know there's many apps in the Playstore that gets the job done but that is true for literally most OnePlus apps yet it didn't stop them for making those. Coming from a Samsung phone, it's a problem for me because Samsung has their own music and video player that don't show ads or anything. It does have Google Play music app but I didn't like the orange UI with light background and other playstore apps don't integrate with the OnePlus lockscreen well.Updates: The sim problem seems to have resolved by itself. Battery life is terrible even at very low brightness but does charge quickly. The display is very reflective, i.e it's hard to see things outdoors because of it. Although, it's possible the pre applied screen protector is the cause.

  if you are looking for premium phone with below mention quality.1. Best UI ( Speed interaction with app and ad free2. Best camera quality - camera is same as oneplus 83. best AMOLED screen - awesome black and brightness, vivid color experience4. Best battery back up and charging speed- 1 hr full charge/ 30 min - 70%5. 90HZ smooth refresh rate - it actually cool if haven't experience6. great loud speaker quality - its feels premium and with little bass -7. compact size phone - not big and not small - perfect hand size for all daily use.8. support of good developers and quality team -from my side there is no CON in phone as my last phone was redmi note 4 ( we should create less e waste and Value our money )I miss headphone jack, however we should accept modern technology and use Bluetooth earphone as 3.5mm jack is way more old technology.i suggest spend on phone who last long with less ( zero ) problems so choose it wisely, instead of spending 20K- 23k on redmi, samsung or other, Oneplus really provide value for money.

  First of all, this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations. Amzed with the features offered, I Pre-ordered Oneplus nord and waited 9 days for the delivery. After switching on my device, I just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display. This is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels. My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying.

  I m a OnePlus fan, still disappointed. The green and magenta tint on display is very real, whenever there is something grey on the screen which will be  a lot if you use dark mode, the display just goes crazy, showing all tints from green to pink.Secondly, there are some issues with Google Play services that doesn't load up a search or a page in one go but that might get fixed with ota.Cameras are a mixed bag, if you take selfies soo much, it sucks in indoor lighting conditions, very good in outdoors but not indoors.Rest of the phone is what you would expect, 90Hz display,you will forget after using it for a day and when u go back to 60hz it's not a discernable difference as every reviewer says so. You will see difference b/w 60 nd 120hz but not so much here.Buy this only if you are looking for a OnePlus phone, otherwise there's better out there.

  First things first- it feels like a premium phone in a budget. You get what you paid for.Listing pros and cons here:Pros:1.The processor coupled with ample ram and storage is fast enough to carry your day to day tasks, no lags or hang issues2.the OS is smooth and clean(NO ADS). Dark mode is a great addition.3. Display is great, punchy and vibrant. It gives an edge over its competitors3. Sound is loud enough4. Very good call quality5. The first primary camera and second ultra wide camera wont disappoint you.Cons:1. Facing bluetooth connectivity and drop issues with wireless headphones. Two rounds of updates stating bluetooth fixes didnt fix it.2. Punch hole could have been a single one.

  Ordered on 26th Sep afternoon and Amazon delivered by 8 PM.. Kudos to Amazon on that.. Ws deliberating between Samsung A71 and Oneplus Nord.. Finally went with Nord and I should say I made the right decision.. The phone is blazing fast and feels premium with that wonderful screen.. Though I would have liked a metal body instead of plastic, the phone will live in a case anyway so optics should not be a problem.. Long term durability is something to watch out for.. Camera is great and as everyone has rightly noted Macro camera is useless.. But not a deal breaker.. Reception is great.. Sound quality for a mono speaker is awesome.. Battery backup is good too.. Overall a phone you cannot go wrong.. Great stuff from Oneplus.. Highly recommended..

Clean and clear android OS and fully customisable3. Battery performance not so bad (5-6hours*) (4-5hours with 90Hz RR and game like COD/A9)4. Dark mode is awesome5.

Only main cam works fine other 3cam just for show off3. If you switch from LCD screen to OLED you will feel pain in your eyes or sever dizziness Within 30mins of use4. YouTube Video available up to 1080. 4K video option not available5. Fingerprint And face unlock features , I Donot think it‚Äôs secure enough6. Plastic side body so use with care. I got screech within a hour of unboxing7. 90Hz RR consume more juice than 60hz8. Battery drain without use. Over night drain up to 10-15%9.

  I am giving feedback after use of 1 week. Over all phone is good, sometime it gets slow. I faced hanging issue at the very first day but then after that did not face such issue . Sometime I can't listen any voicemails or videos, it gets blanked then I have to restart device. It happened twice in a week and when it's brand new phone it's not acceptable. Only 48 MP cam is quite good, rest all are ok ok but not good..I don't know why this people have gave that 2 MP cam, instead of that they would have given 3.5 mm jack or something else.  Battery life is more than average, it's good to use. I only love one thing that is charger. I will edit review later if anything gets changes in performance.Facing bluetooth connectivity issue like alot. It's not acceptable.

  Best valued phone which I got. 12 Gb Ram and 256 Gb storage at the best price. I have actually booked the phone on 27th July and received the phone 1 day before the launch. I was surprised on the Delivery Schedule of Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the early delivery.One Plus phones I always rely on for a longer term of about 2 to 3 years. Upgrading my One Plus 6 to Nord was an outstanding deal. Thanks One Plus for early dispatch.About the phone :1. It is 5G Ready, though we don‚Äôt have 5G Network in India. (It‚Äôs coming)2. The camera quality is outstanding.3. Voice output same as other One Plus models4. A little sleeker than other models.5. Finish on the edges is truly praising.6. Colour of the phone (Grey) is soothing.7. Transparent back bumper Cover along with the phone is of good quality.All in all, I love this phone so much I am planning to buy one more.

  Switching from iOS to Android wasn't an easy choice, but I had heard that if someone wants to move from apple to android then OnePlus should be the one, due to it's clean UI.I might be nitpicking but I have so many small-small issues with this one.1. Notification- the way notifications used to appear in Apple was way more simplified than it's here. It gives you so many options to manage your notification that everything suddenly looks so complicated.2. Max limit to notifications- This is one of the lesser known con about this phone. I use the Twitter app a lot. But this phone limits the maximum notification for a app to 22. If you're follwoing someone who regularly posts then you will end up missing many posts from that person.3. Call recording- The Biggest CON. While recording a call, it will play a voice message and alert the other party that call recording has started. This just fails the entire purpose of having this feature. Also there's no option to automatically record all the calls.4. Vol up down button- by default the volume up down buttom is set to media. So an extra step is added if you want to reduce the ringer volume.5. Battery- Battery is just average. Lasts one day on power saver mode. Without that it's tough to last it for a day. Although the fast charging feature is pretty good.6. Camera quality is good but deteriorates and becomes shaky on zoom. Though it performs well in low light conditions.7. Fingerprint scanner- although the accuracy is good and it picks up even if your thumb is a little wet, but it's just a notch slow. Again comparing it with my previous phone- iPhone 7

  Overall perfomance of the phone is amazing.best in class perfomance in this price range .It feels really nice in the hands.Best diplay for this price i'd say. Camera is definitely similar to oneplus 8,but its not the same although,nord is lacking some of the features of oneplus 8 camera.charging is pretty fast 0 to 100 in less than an hr. eventhough the battery is morethan 4000 mah the display and hardware comsumes a lot of power, so battery backup is not so great but above average.Operating system is lot smoother with less bugsOverall i my perspective,considering the brand value and the product value oneplus is giving,for sure it ll be really a money worth purchase.PROS*Supperb camera perfomance in this price range .*Pretty quick charging.*Nyz display in this price*Front camera wide angle is awesome.*bigger display and 90Hz refresh rate.*Smooth os with less bugs.CONS*Lacking the premium buit quality out of the box.Overall its a plastic body*The volume mute slider feels a bit low quality in the daily usage.*In display fingerprint scanner is not as faster as a sidemounted scanner.*Battery backup is not great as expected but considering the display size ,its ok with that.*Sometimes proximity censor goes crazy while calling and endup with making the call hold or muted probably.

  One plus Nord is a decent High-Mid range smartphone which gives promising performance and overall great value for money.Look & In-hand feel:Excellent look and build except the frame which is plastic. Corning gorilla glass 5 on both sides is good protection against physical scratches and damages. In hand weight balance is pretty good. Doesn't feel heavier.Build quality:With some compromises due to its price, it's still a robust device to own. A typical premium feel.UI & OS:Excellent job. No complaints here. Clean UI and bloatware free OS gives a seamless performance.Battery:Average 7 hours SoT with normal usage.So decent battery life. No heating issues. 30T warp charging does a great job. 50~55 min for 0 to 100.Camera:Good hardware for camera in place, but scope of improvement still exists.Pros:-Great 90Hz fluid amoled display-5G enabled-Clean UI-Decent Camera-Alert slider-30 watt fast chargingCons:-No expandable storage-No headphone jackVerdict:Go for it if you want decent overall performance as Q 765G won't offer the same performance as Q 855 or 855+ hence gamers need to rethink.

  Ignore all reviews on YouTube or any other channel and you will have a best phone in your hand and that is OnePlus Nord. I gone through reviews but still I took chance and now I am totally satisfied with my decision of buying Nord. Everything is best in class from built quality to cameras and performance. Super smooth performance without any lag and also no ads big relief. For headphone jack you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy usb c type to 3.5 mm jack converter from local market,I got it for 120rs and believe me it is awesome sound with powerful base.(my headphones are of iphone). Phone speaker is very loud most of us use headphones so that is not a issue. Macro camera is not that good bt again that's not a big issue bcz rear camera click stunning pictures also nightscape mode gives superb results. Front camera is awesome. Battery backup a big thumbs up for it bcz I am normal user. Charges in time which is promised by company. Finally Never Settle for any other phone go for Nord.

  It's really great device and awesome daily driver. But it's seems like OnePlus really lacks in camera and display quality. Yes camera is bad if you someone who want better camera and take lot of pictures then this phone is not for you at all. About the display well display is good but yes it do have tint issue and it's noticable and also effecting using experience if your really serious about color and pictures as a artist or creative person well it might bother you some time specially in night or low brightness condition. So at the end it's good phone to buy and hopefully OnePlus may fix this issue vai update. Give it thought before you buy and also look for some other options. Other things like battery, figure print, charging works fine and no lag at all.

Amoled display with 90hz is just heaven. Viewing angles ? GREAT!2. Battery lifeI'm getting around 19 hrs of battery life on one full charge which is decent because I don't do much of gaming in this, I just use it for social media, youtube and stuff.3. ChargingIt's bloody fast in charging like it charges 10% to 90% under 40 mins which is quite good.And other things like processor, ram, storage is fast, looks premium in hand since bulid quality and looks are eye catching, every camera is good and can take beautiful pictures but I found macrolens camera useless.Thing which I didn't like is that it doesn't have a headphone jack so now my bose wired headphones are somewhat useless while using this phone.Thank you for reading.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I purchased Nord in prelaunch. I researched in my price band <40k, and this phone seemed like the best option.Let me go through multiple factors about the phone, I personally like to find cons in the phone to make sure I don't blindly recommend it -1) screen -It's great, you can easily compare it with sub 20k phone. you can consider it great 8/10 .People complaining about tint issue, well its there but u need very keen eye to notice in pure dark background(room) and phone screen should have grey filled (like chrome incognito). But trust me, nobody stays on grey screen doing nothing while they experience tint2) Size, design- Again, phone is durable. I dropped it couple of times, oneplus themselves shown stress test. The plastic build is not an issue as pre 2018 phones were all plastic. Size i think its more of elongated , slightly larger in hands, ideally should be around 6 inch. (8/10)3) Battery, charging - Well battery is 4115mah, and its good . How did I measure? i have accubattery app which measures overall %/hr and amount per app , gives me complete statistics. I compared with old onplus and nokia i think the avg unload is 9.8%/hr which is lower than rest smartphones. Total time is unmeasurable because its heavily varied acc to usage. Charging of this phone is insane, goes near 60%/0.5hr with app temp of 36-38.5 degree. Considered as industry best. Insanely fast patches and guaranteed 3yrs update. 9.5/104) Software - One word -Sleek and insanely fast. No bloatware at all. (10/10)5) Performance - The performance is not comparable to >845 chipset. So do not compare. Daily you won't even notice , exact same app times and same sleep performance unless measured side by side. 8/106) Camera- Here I think It lacks quite a bit in terms of below pointsa) Low light ultra wideb) Overall macroc) Useless depth camerad) Poor detail n ultra wide selfieComing up to main camera it's great, now great is only measurable if u compare it with apple or pixel right? not exactly, those phones are camera centric while this is overall balanced phone.Trick - Use google camera app and you will feel upgraded to a pixel in most situations. Yes most. (7/10 thks to google camera app)6) Bugs - There are occasional bugs, but they do provide quick updates so ,.. (7/10).People complaining about the phone being bad, is it unusable? Think about it . My dad uses redmi 4, which is slow, horrible bugs , ads etc. which is truly unusable

  No problem with the Nord Performance, as usual it poses no problem in daily taks, also Oxygen OS is best out there but the most advertised feature ^Camera^ isn't that good. The front camera selfie in indoor shot is not clear , it's giving whitish on face , also the back camera 48MP is best but it has less features , the macro and depth camera doesn't give satah factory result. The camera isn't good in this one. Hjghl disappointed.maybe some update in future will help in this issue

  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon.Likes: Phone is simply awesome. This is my second buy from One Plus (first one was one plus 3t). In simple words i really loved the phone.  The grey one looks really nice. Though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice. Good one.Well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack . We need to use a connector . Rest all good. I guess the One Plus Lite model will have that wire jack feature.

  1. Screen :- very good, AMOLED 90hz screen is a beauty, very impressed with it.2. Camera :- images look very grainy in indoor photos, can be easily fixed with software update, using gcam for now, day and night difference.3. Audio :- was not expecting that good sound but it has very good single speaker.4. Performance :- Device not optimised for gaming.  This phone was having frame drops even in 2d games. My previous 14k phone had less frame drop than this. Although graphics were better in this phone.5. Battery :- good enough battery, not great.6. Software :- I had ordered this because of oos, but in new update they have changed whole ui and it looks nothing like stock. Stock-like ui was the reason I had ordered this. I guess I have to rely on custom ROMs just like my last phone.Edit: Now after 1 week I am completely disappointed with its performance, too much frame drops even compared to sd730g mobiles, I'm not talking about games like pubg or so, it skips frame even in Subway surf and too much frame skips in Minecraft and angry birds transformer, latter two are almost unplayable for me. These games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games, terrible optimization, I was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games, which it is notEdit : just installed call of duty, surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops. They were there, but I was looking for them, otherwise smooth experience, do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not, I did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate, which it delivers in cod but in others, fails to do so

    Amazing Display and Performance, Sub-Par Camera.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is a mixed bag of goodies and baddies. As usual, the Unboxing experience is Wholesome and includes an amazing Red Cable Club's Membership Card which is mesmerizing to stare at for hours. As for the phone, like aforementioned it's kind of mixed review. Firstly, the display is amazing for 28k and with that 90Hz display the phone dosent feels less than an flagship. Camera is Sub-Par (which was expected as OnePlus do not have a very good track record with Camera's ), but it's not that bad either. It captures some amazing details in good-light conditions, but under low-light conditions, things go downhill. Also, OnePlus should have avoided that Quad-Camera gimmick and instead of 2MP Macro camera should have developed or perfected the Main sensor for Low-Light conditions. Also the front shooters are good, but beautify the photo too much, that the photos look unreal. Also, didn't quite understand why OnePlus introduced 4K 60fps video recording in front cams, and deprived main camera setup of this. Other than that, the phone is as good as one can get in this in this price-point. The OxygenOS is alone an amazing reason why you should choose this phone over others. It's beautifuly optimized and together with that 90Hz panel gives an flagship like performance (apparently). As for actual performance, 765G is not an bad chipset and is decent for casual gaming and more than enough for smooth performance in  daily life. The battery is amazing and so is 30W Warp charger. So, the bottom line is if you want an future-proof smartphone with decent performance, go for this one. But if you are looking an device for Heavy gaming or Mobile photography, then this is not an ideal phone for you. Finally, no device is perfect, but this one without an doubt is bang for buck.

  The phone is amazing in terms of experience, customisation, battery life and camera quality - yes, the rumours about camera quality isn't true and I'm very happy with it. However, the seller and Amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that I never received. Even after complaining to Amazon customer care, I was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to Amazon, hence passing the buck! Not a great experience!

  Been using this phone for about 15 days now and I think it's one of the best phones in this price range. Everything is good. I mean it's not as good as a flagship but in this price range everything we have is amazing. The screen is amazing. And you can buy this phone for oxygen is only. Cameras are good, primary camera is great and wide angle is good too. But other two are just there for the quad camera perform and nothing much they don't have manu use here I mean the depth camera is good but if you cover it and then click a portrait pic then also you will get the same pic. But overall if your budget is under 30k then go for this phone you will love the experience.

  One of my biggest bad decision to buy oneplus nord. One of the useless phone I have ever seen. There is several reasons behind my sentences.1. There is no 3.5 Jack so u have to buy Bluetooth earphone, and Bluetooth is not working at all. It's not detecting oneplus earphones and if it's connected it will disconnect in few minutes. Go and search on Google u will get lots of topic regarding this.2. Phone music quality is too bad on every earphone.3. Phone doesn't have SD card support, so you can't take any backup directly to external memory. What was happened to me and I lots approx 300+ contacts and huge amount of photos.4. The mobile software has huge bugs and I am damn sure it was not tested properly.5. Mobile has plastic body, seriously for what I paid this much amount. Backside Chinese logo?6. Battery is too bad, even it's not capable to run for full day.I just want my money back and take this nonsense, most irritated device.

  Yup, the title is completely correct.  I never write reviews because it just isn't my thing. Let me tell you the REAL TRUTH !For the price this phone serves the purpose, well actually serves the purpose real good.First of all camera is great, for those saying its really bad and didn't expect this, you guys should've seen the camera in 6t and 7 when it was launched and those were real flagships not some midrange phones. Personally i've installed gcam in my phone and my mind was personally blown away with the difference a mere software can make with the images. So point 1 install gcam.Point 2, phone definitely doesn't feel cheap or less durable in any way. Glass back is good, and it even has nfc which i personally love. Small things like alert slider add to the experience. And oxymorons comparing it to pixel 4a tend to forget that it also has plastic body. Personally i'd consider a phone with decent hardware and fabulous ui better than vivo or oppo with metal frame and glass back with ads popping in your homescreen.Point  3,the battery is also good.  I mean its not exceptional or anything.  I'd be lying if i say that it will last you an entire day with heavy usage. Iphone users won't complain about the battery if you know what i mean. I've been using my phone at 90hz and it is giving me 6 hours approx screen on time and this is not bad. Plus the charging is really good, inbox 30 watt charging can easily give you 0-50 percent in 20 minutes.And lastly my dear gamers, this phone IS CAPABLE OF GAMING.  For all those saying this can't be used for gaming never did the real tests. Most of pubg players would rather play at smooth 60 fps than hdr with shadows on. And i played 90 fps and never felt any lag personally. After a god 40 minutes or so cpu starts to throttle a little bit but that's expected because this is not sd 855 or 865. But you definitely can game, it's not a dealbreaker. Other games such as asphalt or cod run well. Only drawback i can mention here is lack of headphone jack which would've been handy.All in all a good phone, those experiencing bugs or software issues don't worry oneplus has already addressed the issues and are working on a software patch to fix this already. Oneplus is not a brand that will ditch its customer ever. So chill guys! this is a decent device and you can buy this without any worries. Hope this cleared your issues

  First things first this is so handy, right size and right weight.

  If you're having Bluetooth earphones other than OnePlus, avoid it.Having bought the phone more than a month back and used it, this phone is the worst in its segment. Riddled with bugs that refuse to go away, few of them are listed below:1)Bluetooth: The worst aspect which has been flagged by multiple users on OnePlus community and continuously ignored by OnePlus in its 4 updates rolled out till date2)Call Recording: Again riddled with bugs that hasn't been fixed. A simple google search can yield multiple instances for the same3)Slower internet speeds on cellular data: I generally use google podcasts for my podcasts and even after multiple threads dedicated to ask for help, the OnePlus Nord provides slower speeds on cellular data than those on wifiThere are many niggles which range from irritating to infuriating but overall, being my first OnePlus device, I wouldn't advise anybody to buy this one

I tested most of the aspects before the return was picked.Camera is Good for a phone like this. I also didn't feel like using a OnePlus 8 cam. Maybe the image processing is different in this one?Battery is kinda okey, nothing to boast about.

At first battery draining going. But with updating update it got fixed.6. Price: At this price device seems a little much. For me I got Over+ budget price.7. Software: Oxygen os is the best skin you could in the market. And weirdly enough they exchanged from Dolby to Dirac Audio. It is good to stick with Dolby. With 3 years software support smooth & speaker sound is very good.Final thought : At this price enough of a device. It little hurts without the 3.5 mm jack.

  One Plus NordIn my opinion, Nord is a very well balanced well structured phone that will give best results..and justified for 30k for 12GB/256GBAfter one week of my experience...... Here I listed some points which came in my mind....Pro's1. Fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate2. Oxygen OS...Bloatfree/Ad free/Clean/Smooth with regular bug fixes and atleast 2,3 years OS udpates3. Fingerprint Scanner (upto 5 can b registered)/Face Unlock are very very fast4. Camera....Full marks for OIS/EIS... With the help of these, it will take good and natural (not like other phones as filtered) images in day time and NightScape mode is good... 4K Video recording are too good in front and rear...and 4K 60FPS in front is very helpful for Vloggers5. Because of Gorilla Glass V5 in front and backside mobile will look catchy6. Light weight and easily can operate with single hand7. Alert Slider button is at its best8. No heating issue till now (doesn't tried high end games but if play mid level games for hour, it doesn't feel any heat)9. Fast Charging....53 min took for 100%10. No need to download any 3rd party app, these are came inbuilt only....Hidden Space (To hide an app), Lock Box (To hide any Videos, Images, Files etc), App Lock (To lock any apps), Parallel Space (To operate 2nd account) and Screen Recorder (To record screen operations in high quality)11. NFC, Cast Screen, Nearby Share options are there12. Several modes are there to help customization and battery optimization... Dark mode, Night mode, Reading mode, Zen mode, Bed time mode, Work mode, Life mode and Focus mode13. Inbuilt RAM optimisation is there14. Split Screen option is available15. SD 765 almost equally works like SD 8 seriesCon's1. Camera issues in low light2. Absence of stereo speaker and place3. Absence of 3.5 jack4. No external SD card slot5. Inbuilt dailer app (No automatic call record option if u record call a warning will goes to other side person...you cannot search a unknown number from dailing last digits in recent call list)6. Normal battery life....if you use heavy will get 5, 7 hrs SOT, otherwise easily come 1 or 1.5 day7. No notification indicator, but ambient display will help in that8. Absence of Dolby Atmos9. Plastic frame (But because of this phone feels light weight)10. Proximity Sensor is little slow (What i feel)11. After ending of incoming call , fingerprint doesn't work (2, 3 times only till now)12. Automatic Bluetooth connection problem (Sometimes)13. Some people complaining about Tint issue...but I didn't noticed14. Company saying 5G connectivity, but I dont think that it will not help now, because still 5G not rolled out in India

  I disliked the service of OnePlus community.  Community should provide accidental and liquid damage with warranty. It is difficult for customer to know the protection plan with in first 30 days as it takes more than one month to understand the phone itself. So I am unhappy with OnePlus community services. But the I like the product. It has very amazing features whatever its battery life is short but features are amazing awesome adorable.

  The phone freezes and restarts about 15-20 times a day. It disrupts regular usage - if you're sending a mail or typing out a text, you have to start over again once it reboots. It's very annoying if you're watching something or listening to music or talking to someone. Sometimes it takes upto 20+ minutes to reboot.The screen has some tint issues. The left and right edges have a very obvious red tint to it and the center has a green tint. It's clearly seen against a grey / white background. There's also a distinct difference in the area around the camera.Oxygen OS is amazing, the customizability, UI and user experience is unmatched compared to other OS like MIUI Samsung OS. The quick launch feature is great, it saves a lot of time for things you use frequently.Battery life is great, it charges upto 100% in an hour (charging speed slows down around 70%). Device is very comfortable in the hand, fingerprint reader is easily reachable.Camera is great, night scape and pro modes are very useful while taking photos. The case that comes with the phone is also very good, it has raised corners to raise the screen and protect from scratches.The Amazon return procedure is trash. It asks you to install an app you can't even use. The only other way to return or replace it is to wait for a technician to assess the phone.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is great!!Love the looks and feel of the device.The user interface is so fluidic and nice. Oxygen OS coupled with the 90Hz OLED panel is the best thing ever.The speaker is fairly loud. The haptic feedback is good.Camera is good, not great. Sometimes you get really good images. Not a fan of the front camera as it makes the skin look too soft. Aggressive skin softening is an issue.The fingerprint scanner isn't the best thing. Sometimes it fails to read the print.Another issue I found is, it doesn't have an option to lock onto LTE network (only LTE/3G/2G option is available, no LTE only). Hence it often drops to 3G network at my place where the 4G signal is a bit weak. My moto g5 had no such issues though.To sum up, the phone is great!! Pretty gald I chose this device over the realme/redmi counterparts :)The software experience is far superior than any of those.Also got more than 4 software updates with many improvements over a month's time.

  After One Week Of Use. Since I'm the New Customer of OnePlus Company. So I'll give the Review what I felt.1. Bulid Quality- It's Perfect in Size and Weight except for Plastic Cover from Sideon but still it looks Premium and Feel premium too.2. OS and Processor- Best OS and Processor I have ever used in this Mid Range Phones. Fastest Face Unlock in this Phone I have ever seen.3. Battery Life- It totally depends upon ur use. If It's been used for Normal battery will go for more than a day but if you use heavily it will drain soon also. Best part is It gets charged with the same speed with which it drains. Means Super Charge Phone. Haven't seen such a Fast Charging Phone.4. Now should you buy this or Not - If you want a clean phone without bloatware with almost quick refresh rate, Perfect OS and best build quality You should go for it. But if you are a heavy gamer and Perfect photographer You can't do both things perfectly from this Phone. Do remember it's a mid range phone.Overall It's a nice Phone and I have become a fan of OnePlus. Since I'm a normal user.

  Starting with the body and design... It's easy to handle and enables a firm grip.The fingerprint sensor could be faster but it does the job!The battery life is great. Charging is super fast and lasts a day easily despite heavy usage with multiple apps.The back camera in well lit conditions takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colours . The nightscape mode is brilliant as well. The front camera in well lit conditions or with flash takes amazing pictures.The only slight disappointment is the front camera in dark conditions without flash.All in all this is a great buy for the price and absolutely worth it :)

  OnePlus Nord 12gb/256 versionDisplay- very good, 90hz is awesomeSoftware- top notch, flawlessCamera- the 48mp pics are very good, details are awesome, video recording is very nice with high stability... Front camera is good too...The wide angle camera in bad lighting had too much noise and macro camera isn't good unless you keep the phone very close to the object.Speaker- it's very loud compared to my old phoneBattery- if on 90hz then don't expect battery to last long, 60hz with normal usage you can get through the day... With gaming it will last 4hrs on average maybe a bit more... Anyways the warp charging is very good...Network- no issues as of nowMemory management- using the 12gb variant, it's managed multiple apps very nicely...Final say,If you are using a lower affordable range mobile (below 20k) and change to this, this mobile is heaven...If you have changed from mid range to this, don't not expect it to be the best, but it does do everything for its price range..If you changed from higher segment to this, idk why u did that...For this price range this phone has done good...

  Purchased One Plus Nord 12 +256 varient.The phone looks classy and premium.Voice quality is superb. The processor speed is amazingly fast and it should be with 12 gb.Already got 2 updates which claims to improve battery efficiency and macro picture quality.Yes,the battery drains little bit faster but it gets charges exceptionally fast so no regrets.it charges to 80% within 45 mins. camera is much better in selfie and for close pictures.detailings are also fine.Night mode is little bit average but overall if u compare in such range then it's far better than others.In my view it is a good choice to buy this phone in 30k bucks.you are getting everything which is in one plus 8 and even more if u talk about camera.Only thing the basic screen while calling and some other basic things which are trademark of one plus is changed...it should be there.the oxygen OS is great and will be best if u give everything which is available in one plus series oxygen OS.

  They really hyped this particular model. I bought it in prime day sale. I was using Galaxy S9 earlier so I was happy with Oneplus android experience since it's near to stock android experience, not big fan of customized UI since they add so many bloatware.But for this price range, I am not happy with the camera, the post-processing of the image really takes away the sharpness of the photo, and it does not look clear, I tried with both 12MP and 48 MP but results are almost same.Regarding the screen tint issue, Yeah I noticed it only during the night time when the brightness was almost 0 and screen refresh rate is 90hz and the background is totally black, if you change it to 60Hz then you won't see that also, so I won't say it is an issue. I did not observe it throughout the day.Battery life is good and charging is so fast.So Overall it is a good phone but if you are looking for good quality photography then I won't recommend it.

  I don't know what to feel about the phone. It is a comfortable mid Ranger and definitely a run for your money if you want the right things. This maynot be the one for you if you need a good lense or if you need a super fast processor. It provides an alrighty experience and is certainly better than a lot of the other mid rangers and even expensive iphones.But I do have some problems. I am not a fan of any one plus cameras and this is no exception. Camera is just average. If you need a good camera, maybe you should wait for the pixel 4a. Pixel cameras are the best in the market.Another problem I have is with the battery. I saw multiple reviews claiming that it has a good battery compared to other mid rangers and some expensive samsung phones. But I cannot feel it. I feel like it's draining so fast, I should keep checking it and see if it's really not standard.

  Battery Heating issue, Camera is no way near the flagship. Even my OnePlus 6t is way better with just 2 +1 cameras. Quality of video streaming is pathetic.

  Well I am not so much techy guy who can answered all detailed query but i would like to write my honest review about this phone. I was definitely waiting for this Nord (which was rumored as oneplus Z) from March. First will talked about its packing -- Its awesome !!! Device comes in black box embedded with Nord logo...very fascinating.Then comes to display - 90Hz AMLOED smooth and refreshing colors. No issue observed about display which was rumored to be have color fade issue  dark mode. So guys dont worry !! If you worrying about display no issue from device as per my opinion.  Oxygen OS best user experience. Camera - Front and Rear Primary camera both are excellent , with coming update it will enhance. Macro 2MP - Not that much good. Speaker - Mono but still serve the purpose ; sound is good. Gaming experience - smooth no glitches experienced, PUBG user may have different view based on experience. Looks - Its cool, you will not come to know the back cover is of fiber unless said. So overall experience with this budget phone 9/10. if you really want to buy it then Go FOR IT !!!  You will enjoy the feeling

  I am not a tech reviewer but I am someone who has used this phone for good 15 days.Phone has got- Superfast Charging (5% -100% in around 70 mins) - if you say there are phone with better charging speed, sure there are, but what's the problem with this, we are charging phone not participating in race and if you do not have like 1 hour of off screen time then it's not the fault of charging speed surely you need to change your lifestyle.- Processor (does all the task smoothly, from small day to day task to playing high ends games)- Ram Optimization (switching between app is like cake walk for this phone)- Fingerprint (it's fast but could have been a little bit more snappier,  I could notice only because my last phone sensor has a better response but that harldly makes any difference)- OS(it's one of the USP of OnePlus, very user friendly and interactive)- Backup (on my off day my avg uses are like 3-4 games of PUBG, 1-1¬Ω hrs of voice/video call, 3-4 hours of Net Surfing/YouTube/social media, 3-4 hours of HotSpot tethering,  with such uses device keeps me going through out the day.)- Display - 90hz display surely makes the difference- Camera - does the job beautifully- Looks Premium - glass back panel and it's colour set it's apart

Look at the price difference also)*No headphone jack ( I'm really disappointed with this)------Note: You can't compare with High range oneplus Phone with this phone performance but compare with camera its pretty good .

I used an OTG to connect external hard disk and it worked lightening fast to navigate through my folders/files.

With no games and no movies watching and using the phone for youtube, facebook and office emails battery did not lasted for more than 8-10 hours. Fast charging was working though, but then i need to plugin again and again. It started to give me worries when during the phone calls when i used to receive, it did not worked well. either it was a UI problem or something, but there i saw performance lag while picking up a call or disconnecting it.I liked the camera though, it was good and it gave me overall satisfaction. Heating issues also was observed. Overall I was still happy with my old phone even though it has a bit of performance issue.So i decided to return the phone which I am not satisfied with.

  The phone is very good for my usage;  the battery is withstanding for around 1.5-2 days which is more than sufficient. Phone usage is very smooth and bloat-free. I am the kind of guy who installs all kinds of apps to try it out. Not a photo geek, so cannot review much on camera quality. If you are looking at a good budget phone with one plus branding go for it.

People expect alot from Oneplus n which is why they critisize if something is not according to their will however these are the same people who buy iPhone SE2 iPhone xr,x,11 for 40,000 n happy woth feature half then what Nord is providing themCamera potrait mode is meeting the expectationsMacro camera is just the beginning of reaching different league in midrange.Wide Angle is great at time a bit weird..No green light on 90Hz which everyone is claiming looks like oneplus fixed the issue..As its 12Gb Ram no lag good at multi taskingBody is good need more colors available like green, purple,intersteller,lavender..Battery drains quickly as Im a heavy user it doesn‚Äôt come to me as a surprise or shocker...Loving the overall feel of the phone.. this is a phone better then Oppo Reno latest series, iphone SE2,Xr,11

  I've been on using this phone for a good two weeks now and have been following every issue and product review of this phone including going through the entire Amazon section review for this phone. And my opinion boiling down being that OnePlus Nord is a good reliable phone. It won't fetch the highest benchmark scores or blow you away with any exceptional feature, that's a given. However, the experience is as promised with Oxygen OS onboard and the over-all performance you get out of this phone will not disappoint if you have your expectations calibrated to the price and the hardware that the Nord packs. The price point that the Nord comes at is in a sensitive range with a full spectrum of higher spec'd phones and excellent one trick-ponies in this range to the Nord, but it should also be remembered that Nord was never intended to be a Spec Beast nor deliver anything particularly exceptional, but rather it was tailored to the point to deliver the optimal OnePlus experience within the aforementioned price range. The optics, display, built and all other aspects have been all accounted for within my period of usage and I have 10/10 faced each pro and con respectively, except for extreme cases of defunct or flawed pieces..A general rule of thumb to also remember being that users moving in from higher end phones with an exceptional quality or feature will most definitely see the non-flagship performance of the Nord and that people moving to the Nord from lower end phones will also most definitely too experience everything in new light in lieu of the upgrade, so it would be good remember the conditionality of instance being reported from users..The OnePlus Nord is a good phone and it delivers fully according to its capabilities. Nothing is exceptional but nothing is garbage. Except for the 2MP rear Macro Cam sadly haha but that being said is foresable given the mixed bags that companies have to pick and choose from. I'm most happy with how the Nord functions and in absolute tune with the reality of what the Manufacturers intended to deliver to us users. Solid 9/10 for what it is was intended to be..P.S. People Concerned about the Green Tint and Display Issues should definitely check out KDCloudy's video on YouTube about the ""OnePlus Nord/OnePlus 8 Pro Display Issues"". It does a good job in explaining the nuances of the whole fiasco being faced.

    Best midranger at this moment

  The OnePlus Nord feels premium to touch and the weight is well-balanced. The handset is easy to grip and feels very compact to hold. Camera bump is huge, frame is plastic but doesn't feel like it.There‚Äôs no 3.5mm headphone jack so had to purchase a Bluetooth headset worth 2k.OnePlus retains the slider button however it's not being used as WFH.OnePlus seems to have made no compromise with the display, a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. Having said that, the device feels a bit longish and it will take some to get used to the form factor.It‚Äôs a delight to watch movies or stream content on the device. The colours are vivid but sunlight legibility is no good even with max brightness.The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors. The front camera produces good quality selfies.The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest in the business.About the performance, this device does well when it comes to gaming (CODm) and multitasking. While gaming, expect the device to get warm but it will not slow down the phone. Overall, the device manages to offer a smooth experience without any software hiccups or app crashes. For average users, who are into occasional gaming, the Nord will easily take care of all your performance demands.The WarpCharge 30T is a delight as you can get around 50% battery time by charging the battery for 25 minutes and reaches 100% within an hour for me. Battery lasts longer, refer the screenshots (taken over a month since I got the phone).The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.I got it for 26.5k with HDFC discount on Prime Day sale and at this price it's a value for money purchase.

  It's one of best phones available in the market at this price.But there are some pros and cons on this which I will be discussingPros:1.The software experience is one of the best in this price it's best after the stock android oxygen os is best.2.The display is best on this phone it's amoled display with 90 Hertz it's very smooth.3.The battery performance is very good on this device it will not disappoint you it's very it's 4415 amh battery and then comes the fast charge 30t it's one of the best charges the in less than 70 min.4.The haptics are very good on this device the touch sampling rate is very good.5.Camera performance is good but their are some cons which I will be discussing later on the primary and ultra wide cameras are good.6.Then the speakers are good on this device all though it's not stereo speakers the sound is very but not so clear.Cons:1.The first con is camera though it has very good night scape and primary and ultra wide camera but their are two cameras at bottom one 5mp depth which is not working and 2mp macro camera which is pretty useless and not of use it is very disappointing part of the phone.Their are doing a lot of gimmick of quad camera but we are only using first two cameras I was not expecting this from OnePlus this was very disappointing.But if you use OnePlus bullet wireless Z it's very good which I am currently and I One Plus buds will also work good with this device.2.Then their is no 3.55mm headphone jack as they are saying this a budget but not having headphone jack this is very disappointing as they have sell one plus buds they didn't gave 3.55mm jack it's all marketing crap of their own products.3.Then if you are a gamer I would not suggest you this phone as this device sucks in pubg it's not at all good as compared to its competitors like k20pro.So don't buy this device for gaming you will be disappointed.So that's all it's a very good device at this price point and it's future proof also as its has 5g compatibility so a very good daily driver.

  Bought this because other Chinese offerings started to bake advertisements into operating systems giving you the message that "" nothing is free, you pay for watching ad"". Other options were iphone ( super stretch of budget for me and cost of accessories can get you another ad phone). I am a person who strictly believe that you shouldn't pay more than 35k for an leaky android considering what IOS and even a 3yr old iphone has to offer. So finally settled for OnePlus nord given the hardware at this price point : ad free Oxygen OS, SD 765 5G, 90hz led panel, opted for 8gb since ram is an old lpddr4x and not 5, decent cameras front and back, 30 watt fast charging, finally an accurate gps with NAVIC, decent haptics. Note : finally once again started to get notifications, better memory management, quality sensors like proximity, gps, no call drops with clarity calling,  after I ditched samsung a long time back for an Chinese cheapo due to the lags. Feels like quality samsung hardware with Chinese cheapos speed ( thankyou Oxygen os ).

  ¬†Great phone by OnePlus. Amazing budget. Compared the Camera with an existing OnePlus phone, did not get me happy at all. The difference between the quality of the photos could be clearly seen. I don't know if OnePlus tried to fool us, but if you check the manufacturer : it's OPPO. And I could definitely say that the camera quality could be like OPPO less like OnePlus. The Camera is great though, it's not like you wouldn't have good pictures, you could create great pictures if you've already bought the phone or if you are going to buy it, please go for it without a doubt. It's an amazing phone with excellent features which would keep you interested in it for a long time.

Touch response, display are good.9. 30w charging is excellent no issues( only work  with the supplied charging cable)Cons.1. Macro camera is useless.2. Call recording feature is available but useless. It  plays a sound "" your call is being recorded""  when we hits recording button. Audible to  other person clearly. No auto call recording  feature.( People argue that this can be fixed  with software patch, but in case of nord one  plus won't change this google restrict the  removal of call recording notification sound.)3. Display is good but when u were using samsung  mid range before, u will feel that display is not  at par with samsung.4. No headphone jack (not a con) but oneplus type  c to 3.5 mm converter is out of stock always.  Other adapters available in online doesn't  work properly(significant loss of audio quality).Apart from this a minor bluetooth issue is there with nord. While using wifi and bluetooth headset simultaneously bluetooth headset will disconnects and reconnects automatically.( One plus promised update to fix the glitch)

    Balanced package of everything
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Review after using it for complete 8 days -Keeping it simple by asking you a question. What are your priorities ?There are many competitors to nord but none of the phones are a complete package.1) The processor 765G work great when optimised with Oxygen OS.2) Amoled display is phenomenal with 90hz refresh rate, fingerprint reader got no complains.3) Battery life is great (with my usage screen on time was 8-9hours) easily goes a day.4) Warp charging (full charge at 59minutes).5) Camera quality is not that great as the macro lens should have been skipped, but if compared to other phones at this price it gives a tough competition to other phones available in India right now (attached is a nightscape shot).6) Speaker should have been stereo but the mono down facing speakers are quite loud and produces crisp sound.7) Oxygen OS (big thumbs up).8) You don't need to worry about the build (as no one snaps a phone like Jerry does in daily usage), also it is quite rigid and weight is equally balanced.This is my first One Plus phone and I would say the experience is very good. I believe that this phone is a complete package by balancing every aspect for a daily driver. It does not have one specific thing as ""the best"" but every other thing as the second best, which adds to what a complete package should be.- Not a pro gamer, but someone who uses every function of a phone roughly.

It would have been great if they would have provided 5000-6000mah battery. Battery management is good and have lots of options to save battery but that will reduce you premium experience.

  Amazing configuration of processor,12gbram, quad camera at relatively lesser cost was a surprise, but it's not very smooth, touchscreen is very average, while gaming the touchscreen fails to recognise all the fingure moments. Camera quality is also average and so is the battery backup which requires charging more than once a day with regular usage (in next few months it will degragde)With specs had really high expectations but I think I was even good with 16k mobile as the performance is still the same.The other issue I started facing in the first week itself is phone automatically goes to silent mode and even audio for apps doesn't work unless I restart the phone, now I need to visit service center in the first week itself which requires painful data back up and formatting procedures

  Cheap looking build quality for this price, eg.1. Metallic painted plastic sides look terrible.2. OLED screen appears of lower quality than, say a cheaper M series Samsung OLED.3. Fingerprint reader is not so quick.I've got a bad feeling about the durability.... we'll see. If you're thinking of buying this phone, be sure to see it in person (as I should have) Hold it in your hand without the case. Honestly, as soon as I took it out of the box and saw it up close, I was disappointed by the cheap feel. A Redmi for half this price looks like better build quality.That said, the specs are good for the price. It's snappy, and with a case on it you won't really see the sides.BTW, BE CAREFUL not to open the SIM card slot by pushing the pin in the wrong hole! The mic hole is right next to it and easy to confuse if not paying attention. Poor attention to design if you ask me, however trivial.

However, macro camera is useless and in low light condition it's result is average. In broad daylight, the camera of this phone plays the masterstroke. Over and above, this is a good phone at this price range. I am happy with the purchase of One plus Nord.

  Writing review after almost 10 days of use. Ordered on 6th Aug delivered on 8 th Aug, Good service by Amazon.Not comparing with any other phone just sharing my observations.12GB RAM and 256 GB storage and snapdragon processor so no problem with performance, AMOLED display and nice touch screen, feel good in hand.Camera quite good, on user recommendation Oneplus provided updates to improve vibrancy and accuracy of macro camera. As I am not expert of this department but completely satisfied with picture quality.Battery is 4115 mAh, which I think should be more but it last long for day with moderate to high use like 5-6 mail accounts, music, video, calls etc.. Not tried any games.Warp charging 4% - 100% in 70 minutes. Fast isn‚Äôt it? I observed battery drain almost 4%-6% during night without any use. Nord user asked Oneplus to resolve battery drain issue, hope they will soon provide patch to mitigate this.Oneplus provided lots of feature in this phone which are very handy, It is 5G enable but no use for now.Overall happy with Nord.If you have budget upto 30K I will recommend this phone.(Though you will get replacement of items but please read return and replacement policy of Amazon 2 times before ordering anything, it is not same as it was before.)

  Honest review after 2 weeks of use. Absolutely an amazing and premium phone at this range. There have been lots of comparison and negative reviews about OnePlus Nord, but for me it's the best smartphone packed with balanced features. No other phones gives u premium feeling as OnePlus Nord at this range. Battery life, camera quality and performance all well above average and not to forget the quick warp charge that adds to the boost. And it is getting even better with updates, thanks to OnePlus and it's software oxygen os, highly recommend guys. If you think other phones gives u better performance, don't forget they charge you extra cost also.

  Great looking phone. I never thought I would ever own a blue coloured phone, but this color looks really goodScreen tinting / rainbowing is definitely present at low brightness but didn't really bother me. The screen is gorgeous otherwiseThe charging is super fast, and I was quite taken aback by how quickly it went from 0 to 100pct.4g reception is amazing. My previous phone struggled to get a strong signal in several areas of the house, but the strong attenna on the Nord seems to pick up nearly full strength everywhereThe OS has a few bugs unfortunately, more than I expected based on the brand, coming from a Mi phone before this. For example:* By default the alarm volume was set up at 10pct for some reason and I almost missed my work meetings the day after I got this phone* Enabling and disabling Do Not Disturb mode leaves the ringer volume at zero percent, which meant I missed a few important calls even though my phone was not on DnD/silent. You have to manually increase the ringer volume even after disabling DnD. The OnePlus forums show many others facing this issue* Bunch of other bugs related to thisMakes me wonder what else

  ¬†I bought mobile on 5th August 2020, It's been approx. 2 months now and my Mobile Oneplus Nord 12gb,256gb is sent to service centre on 20th Oct 2020. I was on teams audio call for around 4 hours in the afternoon and I got sensor alert of high heat, i thought It is because I was roaming on my balcony with sunlight on it. I came in after alert. Everything was ok, and suddenly at around 10pm in the night when I was using whatsapp mobile screen went completly yellow with no visibility and finger print sensor stopped working. Restarted 3-4 times but things went bad. I did not expect new launch and as a trusted brand prelaunch buyer, I should have faced this issue. Looks like inbuilt quality and electronics used inside are of very poor quality and my Mobile does not have even a single scratch on it (Watch Video). I tried to check by peeling scratch guard also from corners.Disclaimer: I am typing this from my C9Pro which has broken glass for last 1.5 years and kept it as my back up mobile and still it's visibility is very clear. I have shown this comparison to courier guy who collected my Mobile to repair center.

  Update after One monthI'm getting serious impression that it was a wrong decision to buy this phone for Rs 30k.The major problem is not the tint issue or camera, it's the call drop issue and battery back up issue.1. Call DropEvery single call I make, gets disconnected after 5-10 minutes. Monthly updates didn't solve the issue.why buy a phone of ypucant make a call? Thats pretty basic.2.Battery backupHardly sufficient for day,full battery will drain to zero pretty fast. Warp charging can help, only if you are near a plug.Hope things will get solved soon.

  I would say it's a budgest phone for daily use. Performance wise it's really a good phone at this budget especially the refresh rate,  Amoled display and the Oxygen OS. Coming to the cons, Firstly, the camera is not upto the mark. Oneplus has not maintained the camera quality in this Nord segment. Secondly, the battery drains like anything. If you are using mobile data then don't expect your battery for a long duration. Full charge happens in 20 to 30 mnts. Apart from battery and camera, I am happy with the phone. May be will have to give a review in future depending on the observations.

  This mobile is a complete failure in OnePlus Series.I got upgraded from OnePlus 6 to OnePlus Nord ., Really the worst mistake of my life ü§¶1. Poor display( lot of tint- in light theme i can see white and red tints around, even chats in messenger are blue at bottom and purple on top / in dark theme i can see grey and purple tints,100% pure black you cant see in nord)2. 3/5 Pics are shakky and lot of blur . No crisp picture. Close the depth sensor and shoot in portrait yu can still have depth effect. I'm sure there is no lens in it. It's clear dummy and cheated us with hype as 4 camera setup.3. Games like call of duty for 30-45 mins will cause heating issue.Processor and battery is fine.On day to day use yu won't feel satisfied as holding a 30k mobile.The only reason I compromised was the oxygen OS., but now the android 11 update gonna ruin it.My exchange period with Amazon prime is over. But I will surely visit OnePlus service center for another mobile replacement .

  AFTER USING ONE MONTH :-I got the delivery of this phone in 3rd August ( before 1day of launched). For this thanks to amazon. After using 1.5 month I am happy with this phone. In early time it seems a battery draining issue, but after 5 updateds in one month, now it is in a stable position. Now It's give you 7-8.5 hrs screen on time. It's fingerprint reader and face unlock is just lighting fast. Gameplay is upto the mark. There has no place to complaints. In fantic mode graphics and gameplay experience is actually enhanced. Camera is decent, not very good. In daylight camera performance is good, but in low light, it struggle. Selfie is also give you a decent performance. In daylight slow motion work properly but In low light , slow motion is just disgusting. The lights are blinking all the way in the video, for which you can't take any slow motion video in night. I reported it to the customer care of OnePlus and send them a video sample. They said to me, they give an OTA updated for this problem, but till now it is not solved by them. Except this, I don't face any issue with my phone.CONCLUSION:-This is a phone with 5g ready(which is currently waste, bcz in india there has no 5g). So, If you are looking for a balanced phone, not specialized in any section, want to experience oxygen os, take a phone for 5-6 years....then it is for you. Otherwise there are many phones in market in this price range, which are specialized in one catagory (like camera, processor etc).Is it helpful for you, then tap the helpful button.

    Awesome purchase!
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Okay, I was extremely excited for my first OnePlus smartphone.Most of the things are awesome in this price point but there are few things which is disappointing.1) Camera: It's good but not best for indoor photography. But as I observed, it shows the picture and after capturing and processing, it tweaks with contrast, colors, etc etc.. Therefore, I assume the problem I mentioned can be fixed by an update2) Battery: It's neither good nor bad. It lasts for 5hrs to 8hrs depending on the usage @90hz refresh rate. But downgrading the refresh rate to 60hz and enabling battery saver pushes this to 8hrs to 10hr average. But using this @90hz without battery saver is the one I do because of the fast charging. It's just awesome! It charged 60% to 100% in 20 minutes.I am coming from a low budget android *Redmi note 3*If you are thinking to upgrade from any similar or equivalent device, I would definitely recommend to do so because those are the only two problems I faced tbh. and they are not as problematic. The oxygen os with this 8Gb ram, SD765g, and 90hz display is extremely smooth.

There are a few bugs when using camera on certain apps , the quality of the photo decreases. The battery life is good . The wrap charging is not upto the point . The front camera notch gets me irritated while playing games as some of the buttons go under it and you won't get to know. Other than the bugs , this is the best phone in premium budget category.Once you start using OnePlus phones you never want to go into an another mobile company . OnePlus is ‚ù§Ô∏è

  Great phone.Great price.I am amazed with warp charger as it charges within an hour from 19%to 100%.I was new to oneplus so didn't knew that phone should be charged with company charger and lead else it could affect battery life but getting used to it.Though Nord is a cheaper version of oneplus but I found it premium quality and upto mark in all respect from camera quality, finger print sensor to multi tasking.Battery is good but will last only one day or less if you are a heavy user but since charging is very fast so you are least worried.So if you are looking for a premium mobile that is 5G enabled plus less than 30k go for it, you won't repent.

  Really loved it.Using this for a day, and its really amazing and I love it.I didn't observe any tint issue on my piece at least. Even if there is any issue at low brightness, that doesn't effect the regular user in anyway.The only competitor I see to Oneplus nord at this point of time is Realme X2pro.If you are confused between these two:1. Go with Realme only if you want it for games and want the 55W fast charging.2. Go with Oneplus if you want an overall great experience, with the software, camera, changing, processor. And I think it's perfect phone at this price segment.Pros:1. 90Hz display.2. Oxygen OS.3. Stable 4k Video recording.4. 32mp front camera does a great job.5. 5G support with a great processor.6. 30W charging and battery that lasts for a day on heavy use.7. Assured software updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years.Cons:I really don't see any cons, at least, at this point. I will update my review after 1 month of usage.But I think they can improve the camera for low light conditions, and I expect that gets fixed with the future updates.

  OnePlus Note could have a much better improvement, but OnePlus did not pay much attention to it.  One is that its battery is given very little, which gets off very quickly, and the matter of display has been given to the display.  But it does not appear that it will be not displayed.  With this, the best display works in the country and the maximum problem is one of camera and the other of battery.  Once in a while the camera is never able to capture the photo.  Blocks most.  Photo and battery drains very quickly, so maybe Banda Plus had to pay very good attention to both these things.  The rest of the operating system is good.  works great.  There is no harm.  The fingerprint sensor is also good.  Its video stability is also very good.

Macro lense I would say is useless I don't use it. Updates have made the cameras and overall performance better.Display tinit issue is present on my device but after few weeks I stopped noticing it and have attached a video also. Video makes it a little exaggerated*At first I thought it was just too severe  of an issue to let go but then you will just stop noticing it. So didn't opt for return or replacement. P.s.Amazon had offered me a full refund or replacement option.Battery life and charging is good I get about 7.5hrs and heavy usage 6.5hrs  SOT @90hz full time.

  Perfect device for daily driver including all your official and personal needs. This is first phone in OnePlus, though the other variants of OnePlus quite higher range, this Nord is affordable price range with all premium features. The Oxygen OS is good and intuitive surfing experience, though it has the feeling of AOSP custom ROM and UI with other phones, but it is much better. And another very important impressive thing is Oneplus Nord developer team who is analysing the user feedback and releasing the monthly patches which is enhancing the user experience and much stable feature enhancements. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend to my F&F too. The camera picture quality needs more improvement as I personally feel that the pictures are average quality especially in indoor photography. Rest all good...

Pixels scattered. So if you are looking for a good camera phone don't go for it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they don't have any return policy for electronic items.

  This is the amazing device i have ever used. Previously iam using samsung devices which lags after short time of purchase (due to exynos). But this has the best experience and the 90hz refresh rate on amoled screen is just awesomeüòç. After using it for a month my opinions are :-Pros:-1. It is manufactured in india.2. Best display i have seen , neither great as oneplus 8 nor bad. You will get best screen experience. (4.8/5)3. Camera are just execellent, nightscape mode is superb and pics of front cam also great. In ultrawide mode go for in well lit scenes in low light it sucks. (4.5/5)4. Charging is superfast if u are not using it while docked.5. This blue colour is awesome and have best shade like u will never get it on any other device , its unique in design.6. NEVER face any lag in both day to day work and in games. As i am heavy user and moderate gamer.7. Indisplay fingerprint sensor is fast and never face any unsuccessful attempt as well as in face lock sometimes it take time just 1 or 2 sec due to baclight conditions.8. Speaker is best and its loud and clear but gets hot if u play music on full volume for 20 min. Earpiece is great as its very loud and clear.9. Most important thing in the phone is its UI and it has most clean UI (Oxygen OS).Cons:-1. It has snapdragon 765g but in my opinion oneplus should give us 8 series of it. But u will not face any lag.2. Provided screen guard is flexible sheet which i can't say a guard at all it will just protect your device from scratches but didn't in drop. It has gorilla glass which protects your device but always go for more safety.3. Battery drains fast at 90hz which can be fixed in OTA updates.Conclusion:-If you want a device that never lacks you behind in terms of usage and day to day work then it is just made for you. And if you are a heavy gamer then go for 7t. There are many devices available in market like realme x3 but believe me! You will never get a clean ui experience like this one really loving it.NOTE:-I suggest you to put camera guard also it will not affect your images. And don't forget to put up on a bumper guard. Provided guard is good but i think it will won't survive if it falls from back side. Remember safety is first.

Auto brightness adjustments does not reach to require brightness at many scenarios in daily use. so I need to to turnoff auto brightness and keep the brightness to normal requirements.I hope that you will address the mentioned issues.

    Best phone under 30k

  OnePlus nordThe best phone under 30k.Using as my daily driver.The processor is nice Snapdragon 765g 5g processor.The vibration haptics was appropriate and on point.The cameras were great in my point at start it was lacking of white balance and exposure but after the updates there is improvement in colours and all.Front camera is also great and sharp.But there is a slightly problem in battery life because 1 day I was using my phone in 60hz display it was draining the battery faster as compared to 90hz because in 90hz mode the battery was not draining fast but in 60hz mode it was.Comes to display,the display was great. With that dual punch hole cutout looks great and there is less bezels in all side.The in hand feel of the phone was great. With glass back and front and 8.1 mm thickness and 184 grams weight the phone feels light weight and sturdy.And üçí on the top oxygen os this is my fav part because the os is like stock and great experience.Overall the best package in 30k mark...Conclusion.For the normal use, for nice camera and for normal  playing games then goo for it.But if your are a heavy games player than don't go for this because this phone is for professional users and for normal use with stock like experience of oxygen os then go for this phone.

  First of all thanks to amazon for delivering the product even before the expected date. That‚Äôs the reason I trust amazon. One plus more is very good phonePros- 1. Super smooth phone with no lag in switching the functions / apps2. Wide display and handy (which is important to me )3. Good battery life and faster chargingCons- Camera is not that great compared to other phones in this segment . But it is really good one

  This is a good phone in this price range. The user experience is amazing. The display is top notch at reasonably low brightness too. They might fixing the black crush issues in the display in the newer manufactured phones. The photos taken by the phone were very underwhelming. After the system update it got better but was still a bit soft where there should sharp details. The photos are usable now and the camera software being coninuously bein updated means it's only going to get better. The only weird thing are the volume rockers. I find them interfering when using the phone normally in my hand but that might be because I have pretty big hands. It should be okay for medium to small hands. I would definitely recommend this one!

  I purchased this product on prime day sale for ‚Çπ26,500 and I would say it is worth of every rupee I paid. The charging is really fast with the 30W charger. Camera quality is not really great but quite good for day to day use. Fingerprint sensor works really well.90 hertz display is really smooth but battery consuming. just one thing that is missing from this phone is 3.5 mm jack, so Mostly you have to use Bluetooth headphones.

  Yes, the mobile is not its worth 27,999rs  + Amazon Prime 129/month subscription* Ordered on Aug 4th 2020, delivered on 19th Aug 2020, with valid Prime membership* Go for Redmi mobile which will cost just 15-17k* Camera at its worst.  It is as worst as the basci android mobile which you get for 10000rs. Expectation was more for this range and from One plus brand*brand value doesnt exist*there is only one back cover as against 3 covers advertised by One plus nord*Battery is as normal like other phone., which was expected to survive atleast 1.5 to 2 days minimum* Bulky and not slim* display is good*please see the comparison with Samsung M30, before you go for this.to conclude: dont  buy One plus Nord for 27,999. it is worth of 12000-14000 only.

  I never write my review about the products i purchase but this time I'm compelled to write over here.As I'm not camera freak so to me the poor camera quality to me isn't big issue. But While surfing on internet the phone sometimes hangs.Also the bettary drains out soon.And it shows no internet every time i write at Google search bar and i have to off the internet connection first then on it again. Now it may be my operators issue which is Airtel but it wasn't there when i was using Mi A1.Apart from this there are little things which really takea me off like, only white flash light and no yellow LED mix. Too mich brightness even at the lowest.

  This is the first time I am buying a mobile of this price range.. I never exceeded above 20k.When I heard that OnePlus is releasing a budget phone I was excited and hoping it should be around 25k... It was 5k more than I expected but I was okay cause of the value and features it brings to the price...I have been using this mobile from 2weeks now. I must say whenever I hold it in my hand.. I go to another world.. I dont want to exaggerate but the attention to details even the very small ones make this phone a one to easily own and recommend to another...Final word: A blockbuster phone.

  My requirements while buying this phone were the following:1. It should be good to watch movies or series2. Good camera3. Play games without any lag.I am happy to tell that it has met all my requirements:1. As it has already been mentioned by most youtubers, the amoled screen has made it pretty good to watch videos in this phone.2. Camera is good enough. I am not a professional photographer so all I wanted was to take better clarity photos. Nord's camera has done decent job in that area.3. And about the third point, it's better than my expectations.

  One Plus quality is amazing but Had a bitter experience with exchange . The delivery guy didnt hand over the new phone, stating that Verify your exchange option is showing up in the app. Please contact the customer care. After contacting customer care, they didnt help any aspect. I had figure out myself. On the day of delivery, you would get an sms, after clicking on the link provided in the sms it opens in the app and Verify your exchange option would be displayed. After that exchange was sucessfull. Amazon needs to train the delivery agent, how would a buyer know all these things. I had already paid the amount online.Phone quality is amazing and camera quality is good. Fingerprint sensor is ok not bad.

    Worthy upgrade from 1+ 3T
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I've been using my OnePlus 3T for almost 3 years now and I still didn't feel the need to upgrade from there since my screen of that phone is gone. Being an OnePlus fan I was eyeing for 7T. But I couldn't justify the price for that according to my day to day needs.So not being a hard-core user of mobiles I started looking for other options which will fulfill my usage without spending extra bucks. And the day 1+ announced the Nord i knew this will be my next mobile. It's a fantastic daily driver with decent camera quality (unless you're a mobile photographer please wait for the Pixel 4a)Now coming to my pros and cons-Pros:1. Battery life is excellent. Getting almost more than a day with 100% charge.2. Display is fluid and ""big"" (do keep in mind I was using 3T for 3 years now so screen is a big improvement for me. May not be valid for the ones who has used 5T or 6T in recent times)3. Still love the Oxygen OS with the add-on features4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. I'm using OnePlus Wireless Z earphones which connects to Nord quite fast compare to my 3T5. Design is good though I still love my Gunmetal design of 3T. Don't think any other latest 1+ phones can beat that design (just my perspective)6. Signal strength is good too. Don't have any problems with my cellular calls.7. 128GB storage is plus.8. Already received 2 updates within a week.Now coming to the cons -1. Camera set-up. I really don't like the design of ""Quad-camera"" set-up at all. The kind of audience they are targeting with Nord i think it would be much more appreciated if they just give 2 camera selection with some good image processing software.2. Now talking about image processing unit, they could have done better. I mean night images are okay but it could have been good. If they followed the simpler approach like pixel 4A I don't think anyone would buy Pixel unless someone is Pixel fanboy.3. Next thing speaker. Again this is decent mono speaker but they could have added stereo one instead of macro and useless lens. People like us we don't do macro photography and never going to do it with a phone but we will definitely watch some videos and songs on our phone. But don't take me wrong because quality of the speaker is good but it lacks the base. Compared with my wife's 1+ 6T (yeah we got 3 OnePlus phones and one earphone in our house)Summing up, 1+ Nord is a good budget phone for those who are planning to use it on day to day basis. Good screen, good battery life, decent camera and speaker will definitely justify the price. Having said that it would have been a real ""budget killer"" if OnePlus opts for two camera set-up with better quality and stereo speakers. My take if someone is really into mobile photography then wait for Pixel and buy that without any second thought. But if you want a good phone and ready to compromise the camera quality then look no further. Hope this helps. Cheers

Battery-Coming to battery i am disappointed, its drowning very fastly with video calls and works for a day with normal usage, dint try with games yet, but 30W warp charger charges phone very fastly, which is time saving. Overall phone is awesome with this price range with many features, i can say go for it. Screen guard was pre-applied to the phone, but the phone cover which comes with box, when we fix phone in that, the screen guard is coming out as it was not placed exactly...Thank you One Plus for providing best budget phone in this price range..

OnePlus 7T is much better than Nord's camera.Display : 10/10 I didn't noticed any green tint issue in my display and display quality is worth the price.Speaker : 8/10. Speakers are loud but mono speaker. You may not enjoy the speaker quality.Battery life is good 7/10 : I expect atleast 5000 mAh battery if I'm paying 28k.Processor : 10/10 blazing fast processor, no lags observed.In-display fingerprint sensor works like a charm.Overall 7.5/10.No doubt that some cost-cutting is done which is not appropriate for a brand like OnePlus, quality should be preferred while designing such phones.Its a premium midrange device so I expect metal mid frame and a good camera quality with good battery life.OnePlus is able to meet some of my expectations but lacks many important things such as 3.5mm jack, stereo speakers, metal frame.Overall a good buy if u want a 5G device under 30k.Hit helpful!

  OnePlus Nord is a heck of a phone. Got it delivered on 3rd of August. Just glides through everything effortlessly. Just press on the throttle and it launches into orbit. Cameras are just awesome. After full day of usage and listening to songs and watching videos for around 2-2.5 hours it has enough juice to last through midnight and sometimes next day. It also gives that expensive phone vibe. in hand feel is just awesome and this size is very handy and feels light. Not going to regret this purchase. And for haters no screen tinting issues at low or high levels of brightness. Thumbs up OnePlus.

And if I talk about it's in screen fingerprint sensor it's very fast and face recognition even more faster than fingerprint. Phone is quite heavy as it weighs 180 gm. Alert button above the lock button is a very good feature. Body seems like delicate and blue colour looks stunning. Camera works very good in dim light. I will give it as 5/5 for everything.

Finger print is fast but not very accurate  1 in 10 times you need to repeat it..Battery is working fine for normal use, but if you are heavy on Games u require a charge more in a day.. but that's not a problem given fast charging of One plus..Camera is decent for this price range,Performance is very good thanks to Oxygen Os and Snapdragon combined with decent RAMALL in all a very good phone for the budget buyers in 20k range

  My genuine review of OnePlus NordI was really confused before buying this phone, was confused between Realme X2 Pro and OnePlus Nord. Finally I came into a conclusion to buy OnePlus Nord just because of the it's brand value. Still I was tensed because I heard some display issues (green tint issues), anyway I confirmed to buy this one anyway trusting the brand OnePlus.Now I'm using this phone for 3 days, if I can express my experience with one word, it would be the word ""Fantastic""!! Literally I was so shocked with the product it was so much more than I expected!DisplayIt is the best display I used till now. Fluid AMOLED + 90hz refresh rate! Omg!! Fantastic experience üòçIn display fingerprint works pretty fast and smooth, it's a pleasure for eyes to see how this fingerprint reader works, animation gives it a premium experience.CameraThis department was the most shocking one for me. Just like it was advertised it truly is a flagship camera. Most of the photos were looking like it was captured from a DSLR!! My friends were also amazed. But macro camera doesn't stand with the level of other cameras, it's just decent, that's it.Video stabilization is the most highlighting part in the camera department üòç so much stable footage!! One word is excellent üëåProcessorI bought 12gb ram varient to get extra storage (256gb rom). Snapdragon 765G does an awesome job üëå so fast and smooth experience!! Gaming experience is lovely ‚ù§Ô∏èOxygen OSIt is the first time I'm using oxygen OS.

It get fully charged within 45-50 mins really impressed with it.ConsI didn't find anything disappointing, but still if there was a 3.5mm audio jack it would have been nice, but personally I'm okay with it. I ordered OnePlus wireless z ‚ù§Ô∏èConclusion""It's pretty much everything at a pretty great price"". Just buy it üëçüòç

  Writing this review after using my OnePlus Nord for about 2 weeks. I was looking for a good daily use smartphone which had enough battery life to go for a day,good camera, smooth and fast UI and i think i got all of that in Nord.P.S - If you are a heavy Pubg gamer don't go for this device,there are better alternatives there.Otherwise go for it.Pros:-1.90Hz Amoled Display2.Warp Charging (0-100% in 50-60min)3.Smooth and Fast UI ( Never noticed a lag till now)4.Great Camera - Now coming to camera let me tell you the oneplus camera app is not so good at capturing evening & night pics , so just straight up install the google camera for Op Nord.Its going to give you better colours in pictures,better night shots etc5.Battery life - The battery life lasts me a day.I just use IG,Reddit,Camera,Work and Music.6.Looks premium - I know the back is made of plastic but it still feels premium.7.Fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock works like a charm8.Audio Experience with Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z is very good - fast connectivity and good sound quality.9.Oneplus OS timely updatesCons :-None found till now.If found will add.I have seen a lot of you are complaining about the useless 5MP depth sensor camera and 2MP Macro Camera.Let me tell you that you won't be able to use the 5MP camera because it's a Time Of Flight Camera which is used to calculate the depth of a surrounding or environment.This feature is used mainly for AR & VR purposes.Now coming to 2MP macro camera, it's average in my opinion.I didn't expect to perform it like a 1k priced macro lens for smartphone but its okay.A tip of advice for using macro - Shoot objects with ample amount of light.It will give you good shots.And please install GOOGLE CAMERA if you are finding the shots from Op Camera app not good.

  It comes with a nice packaging. Delivery was pretty fast. I have used OnePlus 2, OnePlus 5 and so decided to go for OnePlus Nord.Phone looks slim and design is good. Charging is fast from Warp Charge 30 which comes out of the box.Battery is lasting around 2 days in normal usage. Camera could have been better but picture quality is not bad, although my expectations were high.Pros:1. Fits in your budget easily2. Sleek and mordern design3. Fast chargingCons:1. Camera quality is not that greatVerdict: Buy, Buy & Buy!!!

  Finally after waiting I have received my first OnePlus Nord.Coming to the first impression, it is a very premium box. The phone feels too good on the first touch and the back cover looks great on the grey color version. Couldn't wait for the blue one, but grey looks good too. Blue by the looks feels more classy.The initial setup of the phone made it a bit warm and I have to check for more days to see if it's an issue.Fingerprint isn't that smooth and one has to wait. It would need some time to compete with likes of samsung or honor in that department. It is a bit slow.As per battery drain , I haven't seen any. I charged once fully and on normal usage of whatsapp,twitter , some calling I didn't see any drain. Again have to check with video calling and youtube videos. Not a gamer, so I feel I should be fine.Coming to camera, the 48MP main camera is real good. But apart from that sadly everything is medicore or less than mediocre. They could have gone the pixel 4a way of giving one kick-ass camera. But the depth sensor, macro are bad. There is no clarity. Full grainy. Night shots are also pretty bad.The OS again stands out and has to be the reason number 1 to buy this phone. If you want a good feel while typing , this is the phone. 90hertz is quite responsive and you feel the difference if you type fast or shuffle between apps quite frequently.Instead of macro camera, they could have surely increased the build quality. Or by getting rid of 4 cameras,they could have added wireless charging to make it a really good deal.Comparing to samsung a70, realms X2 pro it is better overall.No bloatware makes it again a better deal.Thanks to American express offer, got it at the price for 8GB.

  I have been using this for the past 1 week now, had bought it for my wife but due to size it has ended up with me, I'll keep it simple:The Oxygen OS is simply amazing, moving from Oxygen ( Oneplus One) to IOS ( for 7 years) and now back to Oxygen has been a breeze it offers superior personalization and user interfaceThe transition between screens is extremely fluidic and seamlessThe battery life is satisfactory lasts the whole day with heavy usage with 1-2 hrs of gaming timeThe warp charge goes from single digit chare to 100% in less than an hourThe only sad part of this phone is the rear camera which is a big let down, in decently lit rooms the picture quality is below average and the colors are distorted with a lot of noiseHowever it performs well in outdoor full lit environments, the colours are nicely saturatedThe selfie camera is quite good and performs as expected even in low light situationsBluetooth has some connectivity issues as reported by a lot of users i experienced the same with my Fitbit Charge band, so be careful here. In my case the connection is erratic and sometimes the phone is unable to find the band in the plethora of Bluetooth transmissions around us.Waiting for the Oxygen 11 update seems its slated for the Nord in 4th quarter 2020 or 1st quarter of 2021, though I have not read any remarks from Oneplus confirming the sameSo it might not be a flagship killer but does the job well

  The majority of peole say the speaker is not good. I used to own an Asus zenfone 5z with stereo speakers, and this speaker is very loud, perfectly suited to loud Indian scenarios.I'm not fond of taking much photos, so the camer's pretty decent for me. Other than that, everything else works like a charm.Some people are saying the fingerprint sensor is slow. Bruh, it's an under display sensor. As compared to other phones with the same sensor, it's one of the fastest.The face-unlock feature is very reliable. It easily unlocks the phone even if you are in a completely dark room.The battery drains a bit fast, considering the fact that it's above 4k maH. But the 30watt charging more than just makes up for it.It comes with a factory fitted screen guard, which covers the entire phone, so there's no tension of buying one.The volume rockers and the other buttons are very clicky, and extremely responsive.And then there's Oxygen O.S.I would say it's a good bang for the buck.

  The product is an overall great package with some compromises to cut corners from the flagship device to save cost. It is evident from the plastic frame which is considered to be less premium but might be a good thing considering it offers better durability in terms of real world use cases when the phones get dropped. Battery life is average with screen on time of 6-7 hours and charging speed of 2%/min which charges the phone upto 60% in 30 min at its peak. Performance is great and casual gaming should be no problem. Camera is really great if you use GCAM installed as can be seen from samples. Software experience is great and there is gauranteed updates for next 3 years which is a must for longevity of the device. The screen is great and offers fluid experience. The phone overall experience is positive with minor hiccups like stock camera app performance, gimmicy quad camera setup(Useless macro camera and depth camera), no headphone jack and above average battery backup.

    Subpar Camera, Great Display & Bad Practices
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I've been using this phone for 2 weeks nowPros1. 90Hz Amoled Display  -- This is the cheapest device in market with an amoled 90hz screen.2. Oxygen OS3. Oneplus BrandCons1. Selfie Camera even with 0 beautification punches out extremely soft pictures. They are so bad, you can't even use them to post on social media. Taking group selfies with this phone is an embarrassment, as photos are so bad, that someone else would usually volunteer to take the picture.I also installed bunch of other camera apps to remedy this failure including google camera but camera's hardware is in itself pathetic.My Poco F1 took much better pictures.My friends (including me) expects better pictures from a Oneplus Brand but these images just completely ruins the brand.2. Oxygen OS takes 20+ GB of storage.I wanted to get the 64GB model but considering this and how in future updates, OS size will likely grow, I had to shell out more for the 128GB model.3. Bad Market PracticesWhile every other brand is giving off amazing discounts, Oneplus didn't. Not only they didn't, they disabled the HDFC 10% discount for the 64GB variant of this device.NORD likely has much  better profit margins than a lot of phones in the market. We all know, it's not a value but excluding your device variant from discounts is just bad.NORD lineup doesn't make sense at this price point. Oneplus should've been selling their last year flagships near this price but instead they chose to release a worse product with likely better profit margins.4. Misleading Ads, HypeGoing to Oneplus NORD website, you'll see claims like flagship camera etc. Opening up the box, you'll get a paper listing out what makes a smartphone great and how it is not always about specs. All that marketing and yet the phone is extremely average.ConclusionOneplus NORD is a fine phone. It would've made sense to launch this in Western markets instead of in India. We have much better options under 20k which makes this phone extremely over-priced.This is coming from a person who is not price sensitive, I was actually looking to buy Oneplus 8T (awful colors though)  or Samsung S20+ (Amazing Discounts, this season). But since I don't play games, I thought I was taking a wise decision going with a company which knows it's not always about the specs. Oh boy, I was so wrong.In the end, Nord is an overpriced, very average phone with a great display and a respected brand ( for now atleast )

Such an amazing colour wonderful experience.. charging v fast (2-100%) in 55 mints no battery draining ( easily lasts fot one day or even more on normal usage) as i am continuously using it for 3 days. No words for display its at par..For camera part i must say it takes the most natural pics with every single detail.. the ones who only feels that camera that beautify the pics is actually good ones should not prefer this phone.. but the ones who want to enjoy the detailing and mesmerising beauty of nature should certainly go for it, takes lovely selfies thnx to the 32 mpxl.. ois is simply a feature that makes it simply better than the rest in this price range... No display issue (green tint)... Its true that dolby atmos is not there but DIRAC  is there to give u the surround sound effec..., despite having a mono spkr it is sufficient to enjoy any music or video... Most handy phone i have come across perfectly fits in anybodys hand.. final verdict a gem of a phone for daily user who doesnt want to compromise on any feature..its atlst second best(next to flagship) in every aspect if not the best...

  Firstly, I need a phn for 3years and above and then I got to know about nord very well after watching many reviews on it, and then I dared to order it against its negativity just by trusting oneplus , and then finally I got my nord on 26th of august, Im really impressed with my nord. It is super fast and the display is amazing. As I went through all the reviews before buying, I checked all the cons immediately after receiving. I would to mention few things that i obswrved on my nord are:Coming to display, I dont have any tint issues & the display is soo smooth and very fast to access.Coming to camera performance , its is absolutely good and satisfied (except slowmotion motion at indoor has screen flickering issue and macro lens is completely blur,other than these the camera is absolutely fine at both indoor and outdoor).Coming to Battery , it is good bt not outstanding(On continuous usage , U can use it for 10 hrs), and charging is super fast.Coming to processor ,it is super fast and yes ofcourse it can handle pubg and other games without any lags.And I dont have any network ,sim or bluetooth issues .And last but the best , OXYGEN OS is just wooww.I also received 2 software updates till date and will definetly inform what i noticed from it after proper  usage.Finally I loved this nord and im absolutely satisfied with my product .I definitely recommend nord at this price range rather than other mobiles.

  Fingerprint reader is really a good one compared to any other one in this range.Battery life is somewhat ok sometimes it is getting more than 1 day if ur using just call and some net surfing.If u r gamer then the battery is not up to the mark only getting 8-10 hours with max 2 hours of game play.Camera The main sensor 48MP is good but it can't be used for zooming purpose if u want to zoom and take its only supported with 12 MP sensor overall the 48 and 12 sensor is doing a decent job .Talking about the other two sensors 5MP DEPTH sensor is good that's all not an excellent one.But the worst part is the 2MP macro I don't know why they included this sensor may be for the quad camera namesake, the most useless one this phone.And overall talking about the phone the processor 765 is futerproof and giving a good performance, simply it is Jack of all but master in nothing. I faced some hang issue with Twitter twice, leaving that no complaints until now.And the best and most interesting part is the oxygen OS, it is working like smooth butter.Overall the oneplus is good in all, but not a master in any section.For a regular user the Nord is ok

  OnePlus Nord is simply awesome from battery to camera it's like flagship killer. Build quality is awesome like you can feel holding premium phone. Fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. 4115 Battery lasts a day and with 30W warp charger, you can charge it in 55 min from 0 to 100%. Along with Snapdragon 765G 5G processor, OxygenOS and 90Hz Amoled screen, phone feels very snappy. And with 5G it's future proof. The 48MP sony IMX586 Main camera sensor is amazingly taking good pictures. You can see the shot added in my review. No complaints and it is all rounder phone. Simply go for it.

  An absolute wastage of money. The product worked fine for initial 6 days, later faced issues like battery draining, mobile heating, mobile lagging, when I tried to replace it, the return window was closed. I tried to contact the seller, 3 emails and the seller has not bothered to reply to a single email.So I visited the OnePlus store where I was told that certain 3rd party apps cause bugs and lead to battery drainage or lagging issues and I should wait for further updates from the applications so that the OnePlus software can then be compatible.Speaking about the camera, front camera is terrible, it resembles front camera of smartphones like Oppo, Vivo. Sharpness is too high for the camera. Utter waste!Overall, I would suggest don't fall or get fooled for the OnePlus flagship because launching something for 26/28/30k only because you gained a lot of popularity is pathetic. There are many other good smartphones in the similar range that are performing pretty well than the Nord phone. OnePlus Nord has been a total disappointment and a poor purchase leading to wastage of money.

I had charged to 100% and watched complete movie of 2 hrs online with hig quality resolution and 82% of charge was still remaining. But if you use for games then batter doesn't last long.4) charging is awesome it charged from 15% to 100% in just 52mins5) screen touch, 90hz refresh rate works superb6) no lagging was observed till now though I had played games like F1 race, will try Assault and post an update only if there was lagging.7) I like the zen mode a lot.

  Phone is great at its processing and never lagged while multitasking, 765g worth it. Camera quality is just awesome at this price range. I know there was some issue related to macro camera but thanks to OnePlus they never let their users to loose the faith in them...they fixed the macro camera issue with the update as usual. Battery life is at its best. Pre installed screen protector never lets you down, even gorilla glass 5 is hard enough to bear the accidental drops. Fingerprint sensor detects smoothly and speedily although no one can hate OnePlus fingerprint sensorsüòÄ. Headphone jack is missing but it's totally fine. Although i did deep excavation of this phone and found that there are some major issues related to camera quality like it blurs when captured picture is zoomed and also some problems with selfie camera such as 4k 60fps video recording takes efforts to open and power consumption of phone also have some general issues but hope so OnePlus will fix it with software updates.

It takes exactly one hour to fully charge this phone and with moderate usage it will last over a day...Cons:The only drawback in this phone is the speaker...it's not too loud.

I believe RAM utilization also plays a big role in bettery consumption. However, the phone has instant charging option wherin you will be able to plug in for 10 min and work for 5-6 hrs for very less usable inputs(again depends on usage). One in all, w great release. Hardware is intact! Camera is excellent. Look, feel and weight are to be appreciated.

  one plus nord lacks camera stability, takes few secs while capturing a photo if moved the photo becomes hazy, have to keep  the phone and object steady till the photo loads. havent seen such in budget phone as well. hopefully one plus can fix this with an update in future. one more problem is as the picture clicked from back camera has lot of saturation like realme hones it looks artificial.  front camera is worthless. i mean in atificial light where there is too much light above head example in big showrooms malls or big shops or supermarket where there is lots of light above you nord completely messes up the white balance i mean you can hardly see the background properly. even the colours come disortedi mean its not accurate. if you click a photo in such condition you will notice the face is filled with light and you can hardy use that photo. i dont know if this is happening in my phone or everyone's phone. only plus point in this phone is its haptic feedback and when you hold the phone it will fit you hand beautifully. no need to mention the oxygen os. fingerprint is average i think due to animation it looks slow. amoled displayis beautiful. charging speed is fabulous. i mean i recharged the battery in around 40 mins. backup is also average. overall its an average phone nothing extra ordinary in it. there are better phones at better price in market. hopefully one plus fixes the camera issue if so other problems can be managed

  Fast delivery from Amazon, well packed and neat when received.Excellent display.Super fast and smooth toggle between screens or app.Camera is decent for me as I have a basic requirementPlanning to buy bluetooth ear pods as there is no headphone jack. But I was aware of this and always wanted move away from the wires! So i may not consider this as a negative.Extended warranty option was the one I choose(red cable club member) and I felt this was better one. However there are two other choices users can opt under the club membership.They are giving a pre-installed protection screen and cover which is cool (not sure if other brands gives that). Also happy with the SAR value this phone offers. Battery remains for 24 hrs and I am sure this may come down after sometime. The warp charging is superfast and leaves you happy.This is my first high priced phone, as I usually purchase one within 8-12k Rs range, so for this I felt its a powerhouse. I use phone for 6-8 hrs a day (not into any gaming apps) but use all other apps as per my personal, office, social needs.Feel I can use this phone for next 3-4 years as it's 5G ready and 12 GB ram is decent 'investment' done.No heating problems detected while using my video call or other apps.Go for this phone guys if you fall in my category of usage/persona.

  The build of the phone looks very premium, however, surprisingly it is very lightweight. It is way lighter as compared to my Redmi K20. Hence, the Redmi K20 feels a bit sturdy on my hand. That doesn't imply that the Nord is not well built but the on hand feeling is well a bit disappointing to me.The cameras are kind of okay. The main camera is the one that will give you impressive pictures. The macro is too weak. Personally I'd have preferred a telephoto. Again let me compare with the K20. The primary camera of Nord is way better. The OIS will help you click better shots with the camera. The nightscape is impressive (better than what Redmi offers). Now if you can find the right GCam for Nord, I guess photography will be sorted. The Ultrawide camera will give you mixed feelings. Even I can't decide if the K20 is better or the Nord.Battery wise it lasts a day for me with regular usage. That's pretty good. Charging speed is pretty exciting!The 90hz screen is a pleasant affair but I am yet to experience its impact other than while swiping and scrolling.The fingerprint reader is I guess the best in class. It's fast and accurate. I have come to love it. I always favored hardware fingerprint reader after my experience with the K20, but Nord has me loving it.One thing I love is the software. I am a fan now. I preferred stock android over any other skin. But, maybe it is Oxygen OS that deserves to be the best. This is quite stock-ish. I used an Android One phone and then switched to this, and I feel like at home. With some renovations here and there.The rest of the hardware will cover you for a complete experience. I guess a metal frame is what could have made it better. Jerry did Bend it like Beckham.So if you are looking for great cameras, don't buy this. Honestly, the Realme X series will fare you better or wait for the Pixel. If you are just a casual clicker then the primary camera won't disappoint and the Nord does tick all other boxes. I think the experience of Oxygen OS should make up for what it lacks. And it's a mid ranger so don't expect flagship quality. It is pretty well balanced.

  I gotta say I was quite unsure on how my experience with a brand new OnePlus would turn out but damn this was the best choice I probably made. The feel, smoothness, customisation, performance is absolutely stunning, what made the experience even better was the fact that the device is seriously light weight better than all the other mobile experience I've had up until now. The GPU though Beast! I've tested it on the most heaviest game I've seen up till now though and I could not see a trace of stutter or any sort of lag. I used to find it in flagships lmao yeah Nord is that good!And yeah the camera experience is a little alright if you don't really care about it much but if you happen to be a camera freak then yeah this might be a hard choice. If you're a mid range gamer and sucker for fps and performance then yup this is the best device you can get your hands on! The battery life, yeah I haven't tested it much but I think it lasts about the same time it specifies in the battery optimization window, so there's really no issues there :>Make sure to get the best out of it by optimising to your specific requirements and enjoy ! I'm having a good time. Oh yeah and don't think twice before buying it just do it xD

  I'm writing this review after two months of usage. Below are my ratings out of 51. Style and design is good (4/5)2. Performance is very good (5/5)3. Finger print reader is good (4/5)4. Camera quality is okay (4/5)  I do have oneplus 7 pro. Compared to that quality is bit lagging5. Battery backup lasts for one day (4/5).  I'm not a gamer. My usage is average. Mostly I'll be connected in wifi. If you are a gamer or all time mobile user you may have to charge twice a day.6. Speakers and mics (4/5)  Ringing volume is good. On call, quality of voice and noise cancellation is also good.7. Display quality is bit lagging (4/5)  If you share the pictures took in this mobile in any other devices, it looks vibrant where as in this device it looks somewhat dull.8. Charging is pretty fast (5/5) full charge within an hour or soOverall for people who are all want a phone for normal usage its pretty good phone.Wherein for gamer it is average, you have to charge it twice a day.For pro photographers, it is below average.On comparing price, performance and all other aspects, it is very good phone.

  Great battery life, easily lasts over a day with normal use. Great screen, under any lighting conditions. OxygenOS is nice and clean and offers a few extra features that are pretty cool. Fingerprint scanner under screen works very well. This is the best phone you can buy for this price, with 12/256 Gb options. If you use dual sims, and are looking for a daily driver, this phone is a great option.Camera is just okay, it's not bad but it's not great. But you wouldn't be buying this phone for the camera anyway.

  Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. You'll get 8GB ram, 128Gb internal storage (20GB is taken up for the OS) & 5G although you won't get a 5G connection everywhere yet. The performance of the device is fast and smooth af.Regarding the display, thers's OLED distortion issues at extreme viewing angles, ie, slight shift in color and temperatures at oblique angles of screen. But its not visible with non white background and  NOT the ""green tint"" issue  that everyone is talking about.  Though it looks normal when looking at the screen head on, blue glare stripes are visible as you tilt at extreme angles of screen affecting whites of the phone(basically any app that supports a white background)One point to note, it warns when you put in  two sim cards, you are unable to connect to a 5G network until they release the software update. Having 5G makes the device future proof. No lag on phone and ticks all the boxes decent cameras and it will only get better with updates from 1+. Included is a phone case and screen protector. It's definitely a flagship killer.

  Absolute value for money, considering the features that it provides. Definitely the the second best of everything, although I would rate the screen performance first class. After the first two updates, camera and power backup just got a lot better. There is ample RAM and processing power for your daily mobile chores including playing COD. Except for the oxygen wrappers and couple of oneplus apps, the OS is pretty much clean and neat.Still not sure why people bother to spend more than half a lakh of Indian monies for a similar phone with a logo of a bitten apple behind it :PDownsides -> I really miss the 3.5mm jack :( . They could also have included a telephoto camera instead of that second front facing camera (Just absolute waste).

  It's a excellent phone , It's definitely a allrounder with gud price , everything is fine , battery life is gud..7hr to 8hr screen on time if you use normally like insta fb Twitter Play games for few hours . Camera main sensor is excellent and also wide angle sensor is decent, macro is okay. Front cam photo is gud and video is excellent. Screen is excellent amoled with 90hz and UI is excellent with already 4 updates came till now. OnePlus always known for fast updates and Oxygen UI.Performance is fine even PUBG and call of duty running smoothly. OnePlus will also give update for PUBG high ultra settings. No color tint issue with mine I have tried in dark condition check many times.No phone is giving this much of specs with price. Truly value for money comparing from European and US markets it's cheaper by 10k to 12k.Cons -Not a big battery but it's fine if you are not a heavy gamer ,plus fast charging is there it's handy.Macro cam - It's macro cam average ,it's not gud but they gave two updates for macro.Depth cam - It's also averageSlow Mo - No 480f/s

Mono audio is good feels no diff from stereo though9. 5G Mobile man go for itCons:1. Camera depth Field & Macro are just for show case (Got Fooled)2. Battery drains faster with continuos usage (morning till 7 30 pm) nothing to worry as it recharged in half an hour to 100%3. No 3.5mm Jack this is a big dropback (either buy wireless headphones or Type C to 3.5mm converter)4.

  Yes, got both the versions!Giving a review after 3 days of use when I finally had to charge the phones again.- Used for HD online game: lag free experience and impressive battery back up even after considering these to be new phones.- Great overall built and looks, more than value for money.- Quite an impressive camera but the 4-camera set up was unnecessary other than keeping up with the market demands.- The inbox phone case is a simple one but not too great a protection for the camera bump.- A few apps come pre-installed and might be unnecessary.The last 2 points may be considered a time-waster but not my fault, could barely find a legit ground to complain. Haha!Please keep in mind this is not a flagship phone but to cater to mid tier needs, for which OnePlus Nord supersedes though!

  The review is after 7 days of use..Well from the last few years I have been dreaming of taking one plus finally nord is here after 3 attempt online..So much hype in this year.Finally got the 12+256Gb variant .Here is some review of every segment1.Ease of use -Well oxygen os is something which is so smooth , always wanted to have its experience finally it's here..The os is so smooth and crisp..with 90 hz refresh rate you can literally run so many apps in background.It is getting updates every week so get ready for android 11 by year end.2.performance - As I have told earlier is is smooth and hardly you feel any lag.One thing surprise me is the Google keep application if you set in desktop and try to use the writing feature the phone response to it very late..3.Battery life - I am hardcore user.I used it as BYOD at my work..all the office apps from Microsoft is there, So many calls in whole day, Battery depending on your usage, I have screen time of 5-6 hours daily, the best thing is Wrap charging its the best hardly took 45-50 mins to get charged ..In the beginning it will take sometime to collaborate with screen ,daily use after 3-4 days you will have the stable battery life so don't get upet if it's drain quickly in first or 2nd day..4.gaming - Well pubg is banned but I have played some other games.. Experience is good.it also has that fnactic mode which disrupts background activities and notification it's good thing to see.5. Camera-Well I would rate 3.5 out of 5.you are paying 28-30 k but will expect something good..the macro camera is uselss and hope it will improve as per updates..front facing camera is good...The wide angle camra is lacking detail..Nightscape is good and portrait is good ..I will udpate as per usage in upcoming week or month..

  Onepluse Nord (12+256)ProsPerformance: 765G has its own sustainability rate. So in performance it gives you the powerful CPU in mid-range phones. Gaming is something the OnePlus Nord can handle fairly well, in terms of performance. Popular games like PUBG Mobile and COD: Mobile run at 100% stabilityCamera: it comes with the quad camera setup 48+8+5+2 and in front it has 32+8. Wide angle range is 119¬∞ for rear camera while wide angle range is 105¬∞ wide. It supports features such as HDR, It gives you a video of 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60fps, it offers amazing selfies, the quality of the produced photos is very good in both natural & low light conditions, the images, videos & text look very sharp & clear, It is attractive & fashionable.(Also check the cons)Wrap charging: OnePlus has given what they promised. Wrap charging of 30T support provides 0 to 100% within 40 mins. Seems like last long day.Built:There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back which makes your phone scratch proof. It has plastic frame considering low cost it's fine to have it.Speaker: There is only one speaker under OnePlus Nord. It is not ideal for videos or games, but it becomes reasonably loud and sounds good.Red club membership: It will provide you 50GB of cloud storage. Also with several benefits.Cons:Battery: 4115 mAh battery provides less backup while you are gaming. Drains quickly. But if you are not a gaming person it lasts for a day with normal use.Camera: It has quad camera setup but Micro lens of 2MP has no use. If you are a pro photographer you better know how to click micro photograph.Headphone jack: Maybe you can call it as business strategy OnePlus Nord doesn't have 3.5 mm headphone jack. So one has to buy Bluetooth earphones or ear buds. (Simultaneously launch oneplus buds and promoted)Expandable memory slot: unavailability of expandable memory slot might give you problem later after few years of use. Considering memory storage.5G: OnePlus Nord is a future ready phone with 5G setup but it allows 5G+4G sim only one 5G sim could be used at a time.In the end If you are a fan of OnePlus and love to have good performance phone with mid-range you better chose this. It's promising. üëç

    Good phone in budget but not perfect
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I loved the display. It's big and super clear and viewing angles are phenomenol. Coming from Pixel 2, I wanted a phone that has stock android or near stock android UI as I hate bloatware or ads and I need regular updates. Thankfully, there are none. Fingerprint reader is superfast. I agree with many ppl on the pros they mentioned. A few things that I didn't like about this phone are:1. Android auto not working. After connecting phone to my car using cable, I see android auto screen on my cars gets flickering for sometime and then lost connection. You can check on this issue in oneplus community as well.2. Time will stay unchanged until you focus on the screen. Even clock app gets updated time after a fration of second. This happens when night mode on as well. When you take out your phone during the night, it will be very bright. Once you unlock, them only it will become dim.3. Edge round cutouts on screen will partially hide content on some applications.4. Google play update fails every time.5. Camera not upto the mark. Expected for a person coming from Pixel device.6. Hardware buttons are protruding on the sides and they are sensitive and can easily be clicked unintentionally. I took many screenshots without realising. I locked the screen many times as well. Buttons could've been little hard.7. As geekyranjit mentioned in one of his videos that auto brightness sensor calibration could be better. There are a lot times I manually had to increase the brightness.Overall, it's great value for money phone. It feels premium in your hand.

  The mistake of my life that I gifted it to my mom. It restarts automatically in couple of days and shows the bootloader to my mom. She is not an Android developer so she ends up formatting every time (thank god she has a backup phone and knows how to switch sim). I asked the customer care and the best solution they had was to take phone to a service center, which is not possible due to all COVID situation and the nearest center is far far away.Don‚Äôt buy one plus unless you understand bootloaders on Android devices. Why will you want to go through that pain. Never for your parents. Other than this everything else on the phone is ok.

  Bluetooth connectivity issue after a week or so using this mobile. Thought the issue was with the BT headset, bought a new bt headset, still issue persists.I chose Nord for watching media, gaming and the ad-free software experience. I have no complaints with gaming, I can play COD without any lag. But media streaming is where I'm completely disappointed with the oxygen OS. Can't watch a video peacefully for 5 minutes in any streaming app because of bluetooth disconnect issue.Facing small hiccups couple of times a day while using day to day apps like YouTube or Instagram, but tolarable.Battery is very average. Will not last a day. Heavy users please avoid this device.Oneplus Customer service is worst. No resolution will be provided even after all the logs and mail conversations for more than a month.Fingerprint sensor is kind of slow and not up to the mark.

But when i connected to wifi i was able to play these game.  I tried changing sims, resetting wiffi and internet setting,i even factory reset the phone but nothing works. Either oneplus should explain this strange network issue and come with a solution or everyone should get a refund or replacement.

    Amazon is cheating
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Amazon is clearly cheating through the HDFC cash back bonus offer. They mentioned if the total bill amount is more than 30k then there will be a discount of 1750/- and a bonus cashback of 1250/-. However spite of my order size being more than 30k they are not giving the cashback, saying that because with the discount of 1750/- the total amount was less than 30k so we cannot pay the cashback of 1250/-. It clearly means that the bonus was applicable for bill amount of 31750/- and not 30000/- (similar situation would have been of bonus cash back above 1lac, where they were giving 5k of cashback).This is clear case of cheating/confusing the buyer. Although the phone product is very good

  ProsValue for money. I availed the Amazon exchange program as well. Hats off to oneplus for engineering this product. The 90hz panel is the best feature of the phone. The 765g does not feel slow at all. I have the 12g ram variant. Build quality is very good even though the frame is plastic. The marble blue color is beautiful. The stock android experience is really cool.ConsA little disappointed with the camera package. Though there are 5 to 6 of them, I feel they should have cut down on the numbers and focused on improving the wide angle lens and overall image processing.

  If your are old Oneplus user you will be disappointed. I am sharing my view based on comparing my old Oneplus 5TIf you consider Camera this is not worth the upgrade from Oneplus 5, 5T, 6, and 6T Camera. (Take a pic with trees or plants in the background and compare)Sound (Speaker) is averageBattery life is same as Oneplus 5TOnly good think is display is smooth.Processor is slow compare to Oneplus 5T. Takes time to click and process the images initially is shows pixels in-the images after sometimes it loads.Apps repose is slow (Instagram, Olx, Facebook.)Network (JIO) Is not up-to the markIf you downloading something and try to use other apps its takes time to respondEven with the full network coverage Browser goes offline.Only with the Hype by saying 5G ready and Lesser availability there are marketing this phone.5G is minimum 1.5 yrs away think before buying this phone

  The phone is good overall. No performance issues whatsoever (it has beefed up specs, so yeah) and the good old Oxygen OS is snappy as ever. The display is good too (colors pop). The main camera (back camera) is great. It has a lot of detail, handles dynamic range well and the photos come out good (albeit a tad bit on the brighter side). The wide angle camera is okay at best. The macro, meh. The selfie camera is fine too (but struggles heavily under low light).Overall a good phone, with a good main camera (others are just ok)

  I had this mobile in my hands on 17th August 2020. Now I am writing this these review to share my 2 month experience with this phone. First of all these phone is best in range with its quality and hands on experience. But for details I am writing pros and cons1) Camera quality: it improved after getting updates. Many reviewers said the micro lens is of no use but I think you can use micro camera in scanning small documents and photographs.  Pros : The day light camera (both front and back) are excellent. An awesome nightscape mode.  Cons: sometimes lacks on touch click, it takes slightly more time to click photos. The video quality can be improved. And the night time selfie very much disappointed me.2) Battery life and charging:- overall is good. It has one day complete battery life( when you charged it 100%) for normal use. But if your screen life is nearly 8-10 hours you'll need to charge twice.Charging is very fast from 0 to 70-80%. But it takes time after 80%. Sometimes the mobile gets heats up. And during that time the charging speed is very slow. My advice is to charge it only through OnePlus redcable charger. From the other chargers it take too much time.3) Body and screen: Dropped from my pocket (with cover) 2 time from a distance of 3_4feet, no effect on body or screen. The screen and body gives a great experience. But corning area is of plastic and it is getting scratches on it.The phone and messaging apps are of Google and were not those in others OnePlus phones, there is recording call option available in phone app but when I click it says ""Your phone is recording"" which is audible to both the callers. That's not good.Other than these the processor, 90hz refresh rate and OnePlus os gives you a great experience.

  I am One Plus user since 2016, and Bought this Phone after a Lot of reviews and a months wait.No reviewer, absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility.If you ask me features.. i cant say they are any less than expected. I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn't heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to ""Item received is defective/does not work properly."".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution.

  Received mobile even before sale started on AmazonSo one of the first customer to useThe phone touch is like butter and design is really goodI switched from OnePlus 5T to Nord ,so no issue in understanding the features.Oxygen is the beast UI in Mobile phonesPro's1.90Hz display-This you will understand the difference when to switch between apps, gaming and reading articles2. Fluid AMOLED display better than many phones in this range....compared with few Mobiles that my friends have.. OnePlus Nord is way better3. Battery life is just awesome.. even at 90Hz4. Design is very pleasing and elegant5. Camera- Rare Camera & Front both are good ...I don't use much still I think OnePlus must give update through which it can improve alot .6. Oxygen OS- Best in market & and best in class7. Warp charge is insanely fast wow....fast (30W)Con's (Mostly are expectations as a old OnePlus user)1. Side body being metal than bring plastic2. More colours, I like one which I have but would have being more delighted if could have got moon light black..Important Note:1.Many features such apps having dark themes,quick zoom to screen size, customize app icons, colour customizing and many more gives OnePlus mobile like Nord way more advantage than other mobiles in market even if they give bigger screen,better camera or battery2. Most important thing it will give to all Android updates for next 3 years....100% sure because I got started OnePlus 5T with Oreo (8.0) then I even got Android 10... So no other Android mobile company at present give this.#Oneplusnord#stayhome#staysafe

I seen one or two problems more ...  When you watch hd or 4k content there is problem of auto brightness and issue of display ( green and pink tint ) when brightness is low. Anyway it is not a deal breaker but overall I will give 6.5/10

  Reviewing after 2 week of usesPhone is running buttery smooth and I haven't face any problem.2 Things I like to mention-Battery backup can be much better.-Their is no problem with camera(hardware) but the problem is with the image processing (software).When you shoot in RAW and then post process(LR or Snapseed) it then you get best out of camera.Nothing is perfect in the world go ahead and buy it. A good value for money phone at this segment.

  Overall the device is pretty good. It performs well and charges super quick. Everything is good.But there are several areas where I'm facing issues.1.  When I connect my Nord to my car bluetooth, the car's display shows only 2 buttons (Playpause and Settings). But when I connect the older OnePlus 5t, there are 4-5 buttons being displayed i.e. Playpause, repeat, shuffle, list etc.Before Nord, I was using Moto g4 plus and there were still 2 buttons for which I thought the reason to be the older android version. But the same issue is with my OnePlus Nord. Totally disappointed with this.I checked this in my 2018 Grand i10 stock Infotainment system.If you can help, I'll be thankful.2. Why isn't the rear camera setup able to record videos in 4k 60 FPS? The front camera has lesser megapixels but is able to record in 4K60FPS. OnePlus should roll out an update soon to solve the issue.

    Over-hyped phone! Camera issues.
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I got the phone some days back and I have mixed opinions about this. First of all the camera is not that great. You can get phones with much better cameras at this price range. Noticed frequent lags between pictures and the camera takes its own sweet time to process/enhance photos. The front camera does beautification of photos in artificial light which is a let down. Low light performance is bad (I am seeing this blue blur in the pictures clicked at night with artificial light and have complained regarding the same.) The side panel is fragile and prone to scratches. The fingerprint scanner is decent. I am not much of a heavy phone user but yes the battery drains out fairly quickly. The only saving grace is the Oxygen OS and hence a smooth normal user experience. I had Poco F1 earlier and now this and I won't even call it an upgrade. Its an overhyped phone. Not much value for money. Plus you got to invest extra for phone accessories!Maybe updates would solve some of these issues in future.

  Writing review after 2 week of use. I was very skeptical about buying it and also after buying it, I was thinking of returning it. The main reason being that in display, white appears little yellowish in every screen settings.But after using it, I found more pros than cons:1)Display is awesome. Colours come out real goods.2)Phone feels good too in hands but not better than MI A1.3)Camera is not bad, camera app is. Google Cam give far better results in the lower resolution settings (with the same camera). Although nightscape is better in stock app.4)No problem in gaming.5) Battery charges in about 70-75 mins fully from 0 to 100.6) In normal usage, battery last for atleast a day.7) In heavy mode, battery last for 4-6 hrs.8) Battery some times get warm even in normal use.Overall: Not good for photography and not best for gaming but this phone offers 2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does.

Battery life is great as well. For my usage getting almost 6.5-7.5hrs of SOT everytime.4. Fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate for 90% of the times.Cons:1. Camera could have been better. Dont get me wrong, the main camera(48MP) from OP8 is totally worth it. The other cameras are either useless or are not up to the mark. Selfie camera is also not that great if you compare to previous OP 16MP sensor.2. The mono speaker is loud enough but its not even near the amazing experience of 7T's stereo speakers. This is not a con but rather a wish that is unfulfilled.This phone has been worth the amount that I paid for it. I have received almost 5updates till now, which have improved the camera, battery etc.

    A fine 3 star phone that's smooth.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  A fine 3 star phone. Nord stands out only because of the smooth Oxygen OS and that's the only reason that made me buy the phone. It's been a week these are my observations.They could've done much better in these department:1. AMOLED (I get a pink tint when you lower the brightness when on a grey screen/image), also, the color temperature kept changing from warm to cool randomly at times when kept at 90HZ had to change the setting to stop that. So that's not something that works out of the box.2. The camera isnt something that you'd expect from a near 30K phone, it's far dated, the images are dull and lacks the clarity under low light (Flagship MA), spare the disappointment and avoid using the macro lens.3. Water resistance IP certification could've been better.4. They've replaced OnePlus messaging and dialer app with the basic one from Google.5. They've put in YouTube music, Netflix that you can't remove (you can disable it though, but 100MB isn't going anywhere)6. Don't buy the 64 GB variant. It'll fill up in no time.What's good? - Oxygen OS and it's smooth clutter free experience. - Snapdragon 765G fast processor - APTX HD (lossless HiFi audio streaming for APTX HD compatible bluetooth devices) - NFC (file transfer and future payments) - 8GB RAM and upwards - Charges really fast- The color and form factorA lot of people have been complaining about the display issue. Yes, it's there and it's only visible under a certain color and at 20% brightness. It's not there when the brightness is at low-level or normal levels. So it shouldn't be a hindrance.If you're looking for a device that has a stock android experience (only better) this is the phone under 30K.It's a 3 star phone, because of its camera and the display issue.I use a Samsung as well, but the number of bloatware ruined it for me. Hence OnePlus Nord. Hope you make a wise choice.Oh, if you're thinking about a Pixel 4a, this is a better option, if you plan to use it for a few years.

  I have been using this phone for a month now, and I'm quite happy with it's performance.

It's easy to hold grip even with small hands.üòÖDisplay is great too, perfect for watching videos, reading is fine too just remembered to turn on the night mode. Brightness levels are good too.Sound quality is great, its speakers are good enough to fill a room.Networks are good too, I am somehow getting better networks than others using the same operator.The battery is good enough for surfing through sites, watching videos and chatting for long hours, for heavy gaming you may need to charge more than once but for normal usage one full charge a day is enough. What's more imposing about the battery is its wrap charging, you take an hour nap or even less, and boom your phone is good to go. üíØThe camera is good but nothing to boast about, You can take pretty good pictures, wide angle is good, I didn't like the night scape mode much, but overall good.Fingerprint scanner and face detection works great for me. Even in the street light my phone could detect my face.Overall performance is majestic, I'm using it for over a month now, and it works great, it shows very fast response and all the apps works great. I've played NFS and some small games and it was a good experience.If you are looking for a device that, allows you to explore boundaries, Don't make you wait, and  looks premium in your hand in a budget price. Then take a deep breath and click Buy now, this is exactly what you are looking for.üíÅCiao ü§ôüèª

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Well Honsetly Redmi had changed the market completely with their superior configuration and smart marketing strategy into delivering a decent budget phone.Having said that after using Redmi phones from past 4-5 years, needed a change and then came this mid- budget phone with extradinory specs and  premium design.Not to mention got it in steal deal price by exchaning my previous Redmi phone and the pre-order bank offers.Pros -Display and fingerprint reader - Well this was a big surprise for me as I had not been used to such beautiful effortless display which just follows your command as you want. It makes you feel that you are holding a premium phone without a doubt. Fingerprint reader is exactly at right position and works seamlessly.Speakers - Well some people are reviewing the speaker is not upto the mark but based on my experience the speaker is very good compared to my any previous Redmi phones I was using. In fact you would be easily satisy with the sound at 75% itself.Oxygen OS 11 - I was a Google nexus fan initially which used to give straight pure Android out of the box. Well this Oxygen OS is equally good.The balance between the original Android and the Oxygen OS 11 is very UI friendly and a new user will definitely feel a sense of friendliness with the UI. It has already got two major updates.Battery life - Again a plus point for an average mobile user.It easily spends complete day with me with lot of phone calls and what's app chats with good amount of juice still remaining durign the bed time.And what a charger man. Just 15-20 minutes of charging is required and this boost up like anything.Cons -Camera quality - Yes that's right. There could have been some mprovement areas in the camera section based on the price tag but still it does its part for a medium user.Headphone jack missing - Probably it's a new trend but it still pushed me to spend some additional bucks for a wireless bluetooth headphone.Overall It's a good budget phone which one should definitely consider it in this price range and it surely justify it's tag - Pretty much everything you could ask for.!!!

    One beast of a phone
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  One of the best phones to get in this price range.The bloatware free Oxygen OS is one of the best Android OS to get. So smooth and I didn't feel lag or any kind of problems. The battery package is good and given Warp Charge 30T is damn good. The display is best in class no complains about it and as HDR10+ which makes HDR content even more clear and beautiful. The only problem is camera. It struggle during night in low light situation but day photos with good amount of light the photos looks really good. I have been using the Gcam mod on it it even makes it much better. It's a Quad camera setup, so the last two is useless, the depth camera makes no sense and the macro is garbage. But the wide and 48MP camera is great. The front camera is very good, I don't know if I am right the first camera takes much better photos than the back camera (in some situations). The fingerprint sensor underneath the display is fast as the OnePlus Flagship phones, but when you add a tempered glass on the screen a split second dealy is been noticed but only in fewer situation, but doesnt mean it's bad. The build quality is good, front and back as the glass and the side supporting the glass is plastic which is very durable. No headphone jack to say so. It's a Mono speaker setup good  but not that great. The performance is top notch, I don't feel any kind of issue or drops in this Sanpdrago 765G. Microphone is very good no complains about it.  If looking for a good camera  for taking photos or for photography go for the Goole Pixel 4a. So to sum it up it's a  beast of a phone with some drawbacks. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone in this price range.

Oxygen OS from one plus has one of the best user experience in the Android Market at present. No unnecessary blotware or Ads3. Battery life is very good. With moderate usage it will last for a whole day or slightly more. For extensive gamers, it will give around 12 hrs of battery life. You won't complain about battery because of the Warp charge 30T. It will charge your phone to 100% in 52-55 mins.4. Dual selfie camera is outstanding. Can capture details very well alongwith a wide angle option.5. Main primary camera perform very Good. Sony IMX586 sensor captures details very well. Nightspace mode allows better photography at night as wellm6. Although there is a lower chipset in Snapdragon 765G, but trust me there is hardly a few milliseconds difference on comparing it with higher Snapdragon chipsets. You won't notice the difference until you are a very hardcore gamer7. Software Updates for 2 years is another welcoming thing with this phone.8. One plus alert slider is always a plus in its devices9. Great video recording options from both the front and rear cameras. OIS and EIS help you to record 4K videos with great clarity.10. No display Or Tint issues about which many people were concerned.11. Although India might not have 5G support right now, this phone provides 5G facility making it future proof.Cons :1. Macro camera doesn't seem to useful at all. It is just added for the sake of increasing the number of cameras on the device. Overall camera details could have been better.2. Plastic frame on the sides could seem to be a negative point considering Gorilla glass protection on both the front and back sides. Using a phone cover won't make you recognise it.Opinion : Although some features might not be the best , but when you look at the phone as a whole, it definitely is a complete package.I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a mid-ranger with a premium experience.

  Well, this is my first experience with any OnePlus phone. i bought this 12Gb-256 gb variant and i'm impressed with the phone's daily performance. Earlier, I was using the Mi A1 for past 3 years and needed a change. Since I was accustomed to Android One I felt OxygenOs was the to go option for me this time around.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Smooth and easy to work around with customization and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro‚Äôs:‚Ä¢ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display is good and Battery lasts the whole of the working day(around 10-17% at the EOD).‚Ä¢ OxygenOS Nothing Tops It.‚Ä¢ Camera‚Äôs ‚Äì Well, I do love taking snaps form mobile and work around with tweaks for everyday stories. I'm impressed with the image processing, the nightscape and the front cameras utility. The Image quality is quite good with respect to other Mid Rangers.‚Ä¢ Stable video recording is a boon on this one. Perfect‚Ä¢ Future Conscious 5g‚Ä¢ Battery Performance is a big plus with the involvement of warp  charge.‚Ä¢ Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset ‚Äì works fine and doesn't let you down while undergoing heavy usage. Gaming is quite okay.‚Ä¢ No Display Issue. Maybe fixed over the second batch sales.‚Ä¢ A prettymuch everything you could ask for.‚Ä¢ Good Performance throughout the day.Cons:‚Ä¢ The depth sensor and macro are literally not worth the promotions and hype they built for‚Ä¢ Heavy users might not love this one.‚Ä¢ No Headphone JackI don‚Äôt find more cons as of now

  Camera is not that great as the pixel 4a, but for this price range I doubt any other phone can add up to this currently. This is a great buy or if u can wait, wait until the 4a hits Indian markets.. the OnePlus is a fast,fluid,amazing phone. I own the 12gb version, if anyone is looking to buy this phone, I would recommend getting the 8gb or 12gb version because this phone has slower ufs 2.1 storage(approx 18 sec slower than ufs 3.0),this means that loading games and application are slower and in the long run it would get even slower, so go for the bigger ram versions, also there is no sd card slot so it would be better to get the bigger storage versions.All this and my 12gb version is heaven,for this price range, at this time I could not find a better phone that looks good and performs well also. But if anyone can wait for the pixel 4a, go for it.

  Fingerprint reader is as fast and efficient as one would want. The camera is subtle , the AI does a pretty nice job . The macro camera I haven't used much but didn't seem to be impressive . The front and the rear cameras are up to the mark. Dont expect it to be very zoom efficient, but it gets the job done in most of the cases. You will love the camera anyway . Night mode is super luminous in this phone ,you can't tell if it's a night or evening. Display quality , build everything is good but the battery is drained pretty quickly. Like with calls , WhatsApp & browsing it hardly lasts a day. the fast charger could have been more Efficient.  Also it doesn't feel like a 12 GB RAM phone sometimes

  Camera:  Quality (both front & back) not like a flagship as hyped by OnePlus. Macro and depth are fake. Front camera problem is after clicking you have to stay still for about 2 sec to get clear image else get blur. Main cam and ultrawide are ok in daylight and struggle in the night.Display: slight red and green tinting can be observed in dark.Performance: is good for day to day normal use.Battery: is sufficient and charging speed is good.Overview: Overall ok phone if u want 5G go for it. Cameras are disappointing. Display could have been better. Price should have been 20-24k.OnePlus flagship phones are better. I find my OnePlus 5 better than this.

  1. Yes. It is one the best mobile phone within this price range. In-spite of all other reviews, I wanted to try this out by myself and it's comes up amazing in every corner.2. Obviously it's having some cons but it can be overcome with your smart move. For example: every where it was told that camera performance not up-to the mark. believe me or not but it's really minor which you can modify. use google cam if not happy with stock camera app.3. Best part of this phone is having same Oxygen OS like onplus 8 & oneplus 8 pro. If you are 1st time user for this kind of android, then my recommendation is try any stock android with google phone or Oxygen OS with Oneplus. You will feel the the differences with other phones.Won't say any more.. Better you try this out then say anything.. if not like it you have 10 days return policy.

  This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days.Pros- Amoled Display is very good from viewing any angles. The colors are so rich especially the blacks are really black.- battery.... After a week of use after heavy use it lasts for a day. But the charging technology oneplus uses is mindblowing. In 20 minutes of charge you will get more than 40 % battery charged.- cameras are really great work doing front and rear. Literally the videos don't have shakiness.-fingerprint sensor is very adaptive. So smooth and fast.  Don't forget to set your fingerprint before applying any screen protector.-personally i love the alert Slider of Oneplus devices.-Future ready Device this is 5G ready phone.Cons--missing the 3.5mm audio output jack. I have apple airpods so i dont need that 3.5mm jack. But you can purchase connector from the same.-Missing Stereo Speakers.-don't forget if you purchasing this device in 64 GB storage version. This device doesn't support expandable Storage. I have purchased the 256 GB version to get rid of storage problem.- macro camera sensor of this device worst. Don't try to use that üòúüòú

  1. Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....2. Camera: Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average.3. Display: Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. I have vivo z1 pro & Redmi note 9 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and this is only for 18k aprox. OnePlus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product. 2 rating giving for this. Otherwise features are good.

(Very very fast)Cons:1) The macro lens is useless, and the camera struggling at low light..Overall It's good..2) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.3) The plastic frame but it doesn't look like plastic but it is and it makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.

    Good phone overall - But DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE 2.4 GHZ WIFI AT HOME !!!
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  CONS:- Biggest con is software. There are lots of glitches. This phone feels like it was done very hastily in the last moment due to deadlines. They are pushing stability updates, but not fast enough.MAJOR BLUETOOTH BUG : I have 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi at home.. So whenever I am connected to Wi-Fi and connect my Bluetooth earphones and switch a few apps, earphones will disconnect and refuse to reconnect. This is really annoying since phone doesn't have any earphone jack either. They have pushed few updates to fix this but problem still exists (though slightly better stability now. My oxygen os version is 10.5.7)  I will update my review when it gets completely fixed.- Macro Camera and Software beatification : Even with beatification off, it tends to smoothen and whiten skin quite often (Can be easily fixed with google camera though). Macro camera is useless but we already knew that :P .- Battery drain is quite fast. Playing 30 mins COD (high settings) will drain your battery by almost 20 percent.  Call and camera also consumes lots of battery.PROS :- First of all, this is a pretty decent phone with a very well rounded performance. It runs anything you throw at it with relative ease... All games run with max frame rates at medium settings and moderate frame rates at high settings.- Display is one of the best you can get. Extremely smooth and vibrant.- Camera is very good. Trust me on this one. The hardware is fantastic. If you don't like the beatifications just use google camera. (And of course, ignore macro camera... it's just to increase numbers). But normal photos turn out excellent. If you are a decent photographer, you can easily take phots of comparable to that of iPhone 11.- Charging is really fast. (But kind of useless since draining is also really fast :P)VERDICTStay away till Bluetooth issue is completely fixed... the Bluetooth disconnection makes your experience terrible and frustrating. Even if you don't have 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi at home, most public place Wi-Fi are of this type only.

The speakers are also loud.Also there are some connectivity issues with OnePlus buds.Speaking overall it is a great piece of tech.I like the overall design, weight and balanced output from it.I have been getting constant updates from OnePlus, which help the device better in many small ways.I took the 256gb variant which is a gud one and I would recommend it but if depends on person to person, so I have no storage issues till now.I was able to play pubg at hd graphics which was great, like I was satisfied.Other games also run well, like pretty smooth.Heating up is there but insignificant if you don't play at a stretch.I have been having some troubles with a few apps but as I said they are rectified.I am enjoying it.üëç

Feeling like having premium mobile in my hand2. Battery - Superb. After my office time of 9 hours, battery was still more than 50%.3. Performance and processor - between Good and superb. Few times it took 3-4 seconds to process galary. Might be becasue I had kept 60Hz. I am not gamer, so idea on that part. Overall, very smooth.4. Camera -Oh my god..so much hype there.1. Primary camera - extremely superb. I do not use macro camera. So no comments on that. Picture quality even in 12 MP is awesome.2. Front camera - Well. Here I will say average. Little bit whitish issue. Hope it will be improved in future updates. Video quality in both cameras - SuperbWhere it could have been better ?1. 3.5 MM jack - not there2. LED light for notifications - missing3. They could have provided beast front camera to just eliminate competitors. However, it's not that bad. Pretty good selfies.Highly recommended üëçüëç

  It's a good phone having pros and cons equally. Camera is good except the macro cam which is completely worst and of no use even after 1-2 updates it's still the same. So if you put a black tape on the macro camera lens it will be better üòÜ, at least you don't have to see it then and regret.Next thing is display, which is awesome for me as it's my first Amoled display phone. Watching Netflix, Amazon Prime on this device is an awesome experience.Battery is decent as it has to be for a 4100mAh. Charging speed is something that I'm in love with. I have to keep an eye while charging it as I don't like to keep it unattended while the battery's become fully charged. So it's super fast charging.There is no heating issue till now but can't say anything about Gaming (pubg etc) as I don't play games on mobile.Bedtime mode which greys the screen sometimes doesn't work üßêand I have to off it and then again on it then it starts working.Now the most important thing, tint issue and black bar. I think it's completely negligible in my device especially Tint, but there's a black strip in the line of front camera but its okay and not a big issue as shown by many YouTube reviewers especially those who doesn't get the reviewer unitüòÜ.Video is something which I can say is AWESOME. Even if there is only one subject it is capable of Bokeh video shooting. 4k 60fps is mind boggling.At last waiting for the update when Macro can be actually give performance like a macro camera which is looking like an impossible task in near future.Plastic frame is a bit disappointing but with a case(other than the transparent case as it will turn yellowish in 1-2 months) one can prevent scratches.Overall it's a good phone and the hype created is somehow justifies the product but not totally so.

  With umpteen mixed reviews about Nord and it's camera. I couldn't decide, but I did take a risk and buy it.1) The phone refresh rate is brilliant, I had to actually bring it down to 60hz to save battery.2) Display quality is amazing, the phone comes with an an anti-glare screen guard (which might make the screen look slightly yellowish specially if you are also wearing anti-glare glasses). It's not a display issue. U can reduce it by changing the setting from Amoled to RBG.3) Battery life isn't like over the top but it lasts about 48 hours with 8-10 hours of screen usage (no gaming).4) Camera quality. The most debated feature. The quality is sharp. Specially if you can use it on Pro mode. It's heavenly. The wide angle, macro or night mode. Of course it cannot be compared with a 48mp Camera itself. But for phone quality the images are brilliant.5) The phone is sleek and super light weight which makes it really convenient to hold for long calls too.6) The in-built screen fingerprint scanner is an amazing technology.7) The gesture settings of one-plus are to die for. I guess I am going to be spoilt for life after using Nord.8) interface is clean with no bloat ware except for Netflix, as I don't use it. But u can always disable apps to save phone space.This is my first One Plus phone. But I have used Nokia, Moto, Blackberry and what not in the past. But Nord is class apart.Do not over think the price, I think in mid range phones this is just as good as it gets.

Needs optimization. 60hz seems to consume more battery hardly 5 hrs.UI: missed small small requirements. Like haptic feedback when someone attend the call, it will be helpful for many. Can't able to see daily data usage, small improvement. All will say this OS is good bla bla bla. Yeah it's minimal, Especially I am moving on from MIUI. That's y I am missing such things I used to, which is a basic requirements only. Out of 10 I will give 7...... Because of battery and processing speed of camera and need small improvement on OS

I am experiencing flickers while scrolling many apps like Google, slo motion videos, gallery and every apps.My expectations shattered since I came to know that I have to run 30 kms to service center for this problem. I have to go leaving my work to service center and donot know when I will get my phone back.Seriously Disappointed with One Plus!!!Will not recommend this phone to anyone!!!

  Initially there were few issues with the phone, mainly Bluetooth connection stability. But a recent software update has resolved the issue. Battery life is decent for gamers, finger print scanner works as advertised, camera quality has been improved but slow motion feature no longer gives an option to choose resolution and frame rate like before.

    A very good Vanilla Android smartphone with minor cons.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  ¬†I'm writing this review after using the smartphone for around two months as my daily driver.Cons :1. Display tint issue still persists and OnePlus didn't address this properly.2. Even though Rear camera shutter speed is normal, image processing takes a lot of time which ends up with blurry photos.3. I'm facing lag issues when scrolling down the news feed, transition strangely is not that smooth on 90hz refresh rate compared to the built in  app usage.4. Few push notifications strangely aren't alerted to the user when the phone is on idle. Seems like a software glitch even though changes in the settings are done.5. In call speaker grill area tends to heat while on the voice call for more time.Pros :1. Stock Android no nonsense experience is fantastic, I'm afraid of the experience post Oxygen OS11 update.2. Haptic feedback is a small feature but very effective.3. I usually get SOT of 5-7 hours based on the usage, charging time is quick too 10-100 in 40 minutes under room temperature and normal phone temperature.4. In hand feel is very solid, thanks to weight management accross the phone.5. Signal reception is Good and in call speaker quality is crisp and clear.6. In the daylight, 48mp rear shooter takes stunning photos. Slow Mo and 1080 60fps videos recorded are super smooth courtesy, optical image stabilization.After the latest software update 10.5.8,Battery backup has significantly improved, on the other hand signal reception has taken a hit with some signal drops.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Oneplus nord is a good phone in this price range. But likes and dislike are always there.But my suggestions are below which may be helpful for your next upcoming update.1) There should be a great app lock with some updated features likes when we once open any app which is automatically lock after existing the app & it show lock in that particular app when it is open in recent app and 2nd there should be different lock system rather than screen opening lock.2) There should be also auto call recording, call forwarding, ect. options in call settings.3) There should be a audio jack in the phone which is currently not provided in oneplus nord.4) You can provide more more than 4115mAH battery.

  Writing the review after using this phone for a month. Overall performance is really good. Almost the premium level experience in mid range price range. Fingerprint reader is superfast with a failure rate of 2 out of 50. Camera quality is kind of okay but not outstanding. Even though justifiable within this price range. Battery life is just met expectation with a day backup for mixed usage. The 90Hz refresh rate is tremendously using battery. OS experience is what I felt premium feel all this time. In design OnePlus tried their best to meet the expectations.

  A well balanced device..I am more of a performance guy , so at first, when I saw all the hype, specially about the cameras, I wasn't sure if I should buy this for just for the camera. So I did some research (a lot of actually)... Waited for a week after sale, so that I can get all the hands on reviews, the good ,the bad ,etc.One thing that I found was :-The specs were Good, not the best but Good enough.The camera had scope for improvement.The OS was the best part..A Great Screen...the tinting issue is very minor dosent affect anything for me personally. (not a OnePlus fan but still the issue isn't even noticeable)The biggest thing that made me buy this were the software updates ...I have been using the device since ....like the first update.... And it's just been getting better and better... An example of this would be...When I used the device after the 1st update I could go through 24hrs with 20-25% battery remaining at the end of the 24hrs...(screen brightness at avg 45%..screen at 90hz....normal useage....some gaming...some insta /msging...some entertainment...etc. )Now that's improved significantly..I get like 35-40hrs to get my device down to 20%...The updates have been addressing the camera issues too...but since I am not much of a camera guy..I can't provide much feedback on it...but for me personally....the camera seems good ..All in all... This device is only getting better!Good work OnePlus..... (PS - I hate the facebook app Installer bundled with your devices..)..

  After using this mobile for 15 days ,I can strongly recommend people you can buy this mobile without any doubt.Camera -- looks good which is fine at this prcie range don't compare to High end mobile but believe this mobile will not disappoint you.Fingerprint -- sometimes you feel it's not that fast reader. But am satisfied with this.Battery -- I felt it's okay 4115 mah for the normal users but for gaming lovers you need minimum 5000 mah battery.Why you should buy one plus nord at this range--Pros :1. Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor.2. 90hz refresh rate which is really awesome.3. Warp charger - no heat issues.4. Camera is good not best.5. It comes with pre installed Oxygen OS.6. Design and build quality of this mobile is great but I would recommend all to please put back cover which can help you to keep the mobile in safeside.7. Price is good for 12gb ram and 256gb rom variant.Cons :1. while you play pubg little amount of heat I can feel hope this may improve in coming updates.2. Camera quality have to improve in next updates.3. No wireless earphones provided by the company which is really bad for 30k mobile they must have some plan for the customers because again we need to pay at least 2k for the wireless earphones.Conclusion--- this mobile gives you best experience and am happy to recommend all you please try this out at 30k this is best.

    Neither a Flagship nor a Killer
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Unlike what OnePlus had profoundly mentioned in their Amazon portfolio, the camera is ANYTHING BUT FLAGSHIP! 2MP macro is a ""2020 Joke of the Year"". Primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth. Under low light conditions, it just gives up. About selfie cam, don't even get me started. Overall, all SIX cameras suck.Processor is fast, but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet. So, gamers.... DON'T invest here.Battery lasts a day on medium usage. If you are a heavy user, DON'T buy this phone. 90Hz refresh rate drains battery even faster. Wanderlusters, please keep the charger and an ELECTRIC SOCKET handy. Recharging is quick. Very quick.Fingerprint reader is fast, if not superfast like those physical ones. So unless you are stupid, refrain from comparison.Oxygen OS in one word: AWESOME. This was one of the major reasons why I purchased this phone. Bloatware free UI is something I had craved for. I hated those unsolicited ads on Xiaomis and Oppos and Honors et. al. Also, a near-flagship from Samsung or Apple was out of question as I like my kidneys more.Long-story-short: Touch, look and feel is premium. Great UI. However, if you are into photography, gaming, wired-music-maniac (I own a TWS, so don't really care), or really tight on budget, DON'T get this phone. Rest choice is yours.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Overall its a nice oneplus package at this price, more of it, it has 5g.My review on Nord:1. Camera's colour processing is not upto the mark. You will notice this most while capturing indoors, as pics look bit faded. Camera processing takes a bit time for front camera so u have to hold the camera for a second after hitting shutter otherwise it will be shaky.2. Device is provided with Oxygen OS, the best android skin. Oxygen OS really feels smooth as butter and has a lot of handy features, the best part of it is the oneplus listens their community concerns and provide updates accordingly. But the thing I don't like is the device uses phone, message app provided by Google. So nord users will miss many features that oneplus phone and message app provides.3. Macro lens is useless, a telephoto lens should be provided instead. For macro shot u can try pro mode with manual focus and zoom.4. Battery is not that great but its the fact u will like that it gets fully charged within an hour.5. The display looks great. The most hyped display will be there in every amoled display with high refresh rate but no need to worry u will never notice that in ur day to day usage.6. Phone gets heat up a bit while charging but its not much. Its normal as ur phone gets charged so fast and its getting charged with 30watts.

  Hi I have order 12gb Blue marble OnePlus Nord by amazon on 6 Aug. I got this device on 8 Aug from that I faced battery issues draining very fast also for 5mins YouTube video surfing the mobile getting heat as much. I can't able to tolerate this from oneplus and also I have spent 30k for this device. I have contacted amazon technician team they told to install blancco app and they checked there is a battery problem and heating issues. And they told sir this time we can't replace your device due to no stock. They registered complaint against for replacement ones the device getting back in stock. But my available time is 20 Aug. Please resolve my issue and give a replacement device for this device.Apart from the battery the mobile is premium while using. We definitely feel the flagship experience in OnePlus Nord. I appreciate OnePlus for this smoothness. Only drawback is battery otherelse mobile is awesome.

    A Steal For Under ‚Çπ30,000
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This review is being written after 2 weeks of usage with the phone. In a nutshell, I would say that the phone has performed extremely well for me. I will list out the pros and cons here from my experience over two week.Pros:1. The Snapdragon 765G processor coupled with the 12GB of RAM helps the phone run very smooth. Other than the occasional negligible hiccups experienced on any phone, I do not have any complaint about how smooth the phone is.2. Fortunately, my device has not yet experienced any kind of screen tinting or black bar issues.3. The 90Hz refresh rate is so satisfying to use. Though inferior to 120Hz displays, it barely makes any differences in terms of watching YouTube videos or so.4. The 765G processor is indeed optimized for gaming, as I was able to get a smooth experience with Call Of Duty with Graphics and Frame Rate maximised. I did not experience any kind of lag. Other games like PES and Asphalt 9 were also running very smooth for me.5. The 30W Warp Charger is indeed pretty fast. I usually charge my phone from 30-100% and it takes somewhere around 30-40 minutes for this.6. There is hardly any bloatware on the phone and most of the pre-installed apps can easily be uninstalled at your convenience.7. The Colour Saturation on the screen is pretty well managed and you even have various options to adjust that to your preferences.Cons:1. The battery life is something that I am a little disappointed about. If you are looking for a phone which can get you through the day with occasional surfing and videos, then definitely go for it as it can stay alive for an entire day without recharging, but if you are a gamer, then I suggest you look for alternatives as games tend to drain your battery quite a lot.2. Camera wise, I would say it is good, as the 48MP main camera does capture good quality pictures with proper colour saturation and details, but when it comes to the wide angle camera, sometimes, the edges seem to blur out a little, thus reducing the detailing. The Depth enabled sensor is also pretty good, though sometimes it suffers in recognizing the foreground and background and may blend in together, though majority of pictures came out pretty good. It is better not to talk about the macro lens as they are way below average. I would suggest anyone to not use them, instead click with your main camera and crop out and you are guaranteed better quality pictures. Low Light photography is also average as most of the pictures are grainy, but the nightscape option makes the pictures look fantastic even in low light. The selfie camera was also good as it captured some quality pictures.3. While gaming I did experience a negligible amount of heating, though it could have been due to other factors.4. The plastic frame of the phone is a drawback, though a quality bumper case would solve that problem once and for all.Barring these few drawbacks, I would recommend the phone to everyone mainly because OnePlus is very punctual in rolling out system and security updates. Also there are many inbuilt features such as the one that automatically suppresses notifications while gaming.

  So i was really excited for my first one plus phone but only thing special about it is oxygen os everything else is just ordinary.CamerasMain camra and ultra wide cameras are really good. Although I am not able to see difference between 12 mp and 48 mp photosPortrait mode photos are below average. Very poor edge detection. My old phone with single camera detecte edge better that this one. 90% times i didn't get a good photo with nord. 1 photo attachedMacro camra is just there its of no use. Personally i think i will never use it but even if anyone want to use it its of no use it captures blurry photos all the time.Selfie cameras are very good they don't beautiful you and capture great photos. Both look really good in good lighting conditions but in low light ulrra wide capture little darker imagesTime lapse is good slow mo is average and night mode also goodOsOxygen os is excellent with some unique and cool features like changing accent color. Only one problem i feel is that it uses lock screen password for app lock which iam not a big fan of.Blotware pre-installed. The one you can uninstall are Facebook, Insta, amazon and some one plus apps. That you can not uninstall are Netflix, YouTube music.BatteryBattery on nord disappoints me the most. I use 90hz refresh rate. Its get me total stand by time of 12 to 13 h With screen on time of about 6h. That mean if i charge phone in the morning i have to charge it by end of the day again and i don't even play games (screen shot attached).Charging is great it charges 0 to 100 in about an hour if not using it. And around 1h 15 min if i use it during charge.DisplayIt look beautiful. And with 90hz its its really fast on scrolling through insta. And i don't have any tint issue with it. I am glad i didn't choose another lcd panel phoneOther thingNo notification led is really a pain. Hope one plus provide always on display soonNo headphone jackFingerprint and face unlock is fast and reliable didn't face any single issue with them till now.Speakers are loud and clear. Not to loud but i can say it's above average.Haptic  is cool.Design feels good and premium. And the form factor is just perfect.Google phone really suck. I cant record call without informing other person in the call. It give a loud warning when starting call record that other person can also hear.Phone runs smooth no issues with the performanceso the only disappointed for me is battery life and portate mode shots. I hope it get fixed with ota as promised by one plus on forum

  Ordered on 6th and delivered on 13th as promised by Amazon (Thanks to all the hype and demand). No complaints there!!.Have been a OnePlus customer myself in the past and having used other OnePlus phones, the nord does the same and gives that premium OnePlus experience for sure.Keeping specs aside, let's talk about the pros and cons from the daily use point of view.The Pro's:- Great in-hand feel. Feels premium.- Quick, responsive and lag free user experience,  thanks to great mid range processor and we'll  optimised OxygenOS.- Decent and Loud enough sound quality from  bottom firing speaker as well as headphones.- Best in class haptics for that premium exp.- Great AMOLED display with excellent colors. (There is no visible green tint. It's is just an  overrated issue. If you at all there is a green tint in the device , it is only ever so slightly visible at very low brightness in a pitch black room with a grey background only. So no need to worry there)- Good main camera and ultrawide camera. Also  the front cameras are excellent.- Good call quality.- Great sensors.-Great battery life. Got an average screen on time  of 6-7 hrs on decent usage (calls, video streaming,  music listening, social media consumption). I personally don't play games so the battery life is not a issue at all. Even if you are a gamer, you should get 5 hrs of screen on time.- Superfast charging. It literally charges full in less  than one hour.The Con's:- Useless 5mp depth and 2mp macro camera. It is  just of no use.- There is no headphone jack, which may bother  some people.Verdict:If you are looking for a phone that looks and feels premium, is quick and responsive, has gud battery life and charging times, can take good photos and has great software support, then this the phone for you.A Best All rounder !!!

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  So I have been using this phone constantly for the past 3 days and here is my honest opinion:1. Camera could have been much better for this price. There are ton of phones out there in lesser price with better camera. But as this feature isn't my priority I won't be returning.2. I had been using Moto g4+ for the past 4 years and my usage is not that heavy so my priority was to get a good software (as close to the Google's version as possible). So far, I'm really liking oxygen OS and as promised it isn't bloated. The phone is smooth and since I bought the 8 gb ram -128 gb variant, I won't be needing a sd card so I can use 2 sim cards.3. Battery life is actually lesser than what brands like Realme or even Moto gives in this range but because of 30 watt warp charger, it isn't a huge issue for now. Will recommend getting a powerbank if your usage is heavy and have no nearby power outlet for most of the day.4. There is no tint issue in my phone and I'm not a gamer but I have noticed that the phone does slightly heat up after reboot from software update and once even heated up in Ludo. So if you're a gamer, I don't recommend this.5. The face unlock and fingerprint reader isn't very smooth. My previous phone had a fingerprint reader separate from the screen which felt more convenient. Also you would need to get bluetooth earphones as there isn't an audio jack so make sure you have the budget for both.Apart for this I'm really enjoying this phone. I don't have any experience with newer model phones but compared to my 4 year old moto phone, this feels definitely like an upgrade software and hardware wise and hopefully this phone will last long too.

  ¬†I ordered this phone for my sister as a gift.She was very happy to receive this phone.Verdict.Livable camera, not so impressive but ok ok.Average battery life.Display is vivid and bright.A weird haze of green shade is present on the display, maybe because it's Amoled.Mono speaker is not so good.Problems.The proximity sensor stops working randomly.The device which I received has a display defect.Randomly the display flickers.Red, brown, green, black color bars come on the screen.I tried to get this resolved from Amazon.Somehow i was concerned about the product quality.I requested for a full refund so that I can order a better phone while the sale was still live.Amazon denied and suggested a technician visit, after that they will replace the product.I want to get a different brand or a higher variant of one plus, let's see if I get the refund.One thing is clear, Oneplus has done a lot of sacrifices on the product quality.I have lost trust on this brand.I would recommend to go for a higher variant 7t or 8t.Or some other brand.Update:After 10 days of follow up and spending 30 to 45 minutes every day with the Amazon customer care.I got the full refund.Try not to get into this situation, really makes your day bad.

  After a month of using this mobile, it is a clean,neat,fast & smart device which has an excellent display & OS. The main camera is as good as OnePlus 8 , but the other camera's are not at all worth. Battery life is average for an general daily usage. Small network,Bluetooth & display issues. Onething I am satisfied with OnePlus is getting updates constantly that feels me a premium feel. The community of OnePlus & the clean OS of it differ itself from other phones.Final verdict: If you believe in hype then it will not meet your expectations . If you think I need a good daily premium mobile with a good software updates in regular intervals this is the one.PLEASE DON'T BUY WITH HYPE , SEE THE SPECS WHETHER YOUR USAGE MEETS IT.

  The phone is really good. The blue color is really striking and awesome. Purchased the 12 Gig version and it is buttery smooth, even with a ton of apps running. Display is top notch and the 90 Hertz is super slick. The macro camera is not so useful, but the remaining cameras are super. Battery life is also good and the warp charging pumps it up in no time. Overall, a very good value for money. Would recommend 10/10.

  After usage more than 10 days my reviews:- BIGGEST DRAWBACK : Auto Call Recording function not available in phone. While tapping record call it sounds -""Your Call is being recorded"" and also audible to the caller.1. 90 hz refresh rate is good but due to low processor phone lags sometimes.2. Camera quality is ok, but not upto the mark what i thought about OnePlus.3. Heating issue is there for continuous usage of 4-5 applications some time. And it takes few minutes to cool down.4. Battery drains faster. For continuous usage need to charge twice or thrice a day. And takes around 1.5 hrs from 20 to 100%5. For gamers is not good choice. Phone lags during heavy game. And refresh rate is not as they said. Things happened in the game reflects after 4-6 seconds.6. During video call phone speaker automatically turns off and it goes on earphone mode. (Very irritating while video calls). Becomes difficult to hear at earphone mode and than talk on video.7. Most of time my number shows out of network. Don't know why.? It was not same issue in my old phone. Sim chipset might have some bugs.

  Got my device on 4th of Aug after placing a pre order on 28th July/I don't play any heavy end games on my mobile so gaming was never a problem/necessity for me.The display is nice, earlier I wasn't used to the AMOLED display but now I am satisfied with it.The Battery is generally very good and will last easily a day for normal usage.The camera? well I was never a photo enthusiast so I don't can't figure out the biggest down point of the device.I compared it with my brother's Samsung A50 and observed the Nord has a bit more accurate colors atleast for me.The only issue I found was the tint issue but that too is observed under very rare circumstances and probably will be fixed in a future OTA.TL;DR :- If camera and gaming aren't your priority and you need a good phone with a very clean OS then go for it.

  Good phone at this price point. I have been using for last 10 days.Pros:Good camera - provided some samples hereCrystal clear AMOLED display. There is no Green Tint issue, at least with my phone.765g processor enables the gaming and overall phone experience to be seamless. There is no lag while gaming.ConsBattery optimization could have been better. I have been using op5 which has 3800mah and it provides better battery optimization. Battery on Nord lasts approx a day on normal usage and burns in 13-14 hours with heavy gaming and videos.Missing audio jack, though the phone provides hd sound output on Bluetooth headphones.Overall pretty good phone provides top of the line performance at decent price range. One plus oxygen ui makes the experience hassle free and amazing. Should definitely go for it.

Good performance with flash for both front and back cameras under dark conditions, in my case there is no light in room. Though nightscape mode is available but not good and not clear pic. So use flash instead of nightscape mode. Disappointed with camera zoom And should have been better. Overall Fantastic performance For phone.Phone came along with silicon back cover but it smell too bad. So wash silicon back cover before use. Decent battery back up considering wifi, data usage vid play. OS is latest and meets the exoections. As promised by one plus received 6months of extended warranty.

  I have been using Nord for almost 4 days now.General issues reported by others :- Many users have faced display issue, which I didn't face, not even slightly.- Camera quality is not that bad as shown in some reviews, though I'm not that much using camera. But still photos, from front cam and back cam are good and clear. Video recording is good.- some users have faced battery drain issue but not for me. I'm getting avg of 7 hrs SoT, with total of around avg 23 hours in single charge. In this 7hrs, I payed around 2 hrs of CODM, streamed videos for about 3hrs and rest general work. Also note that during this time, Bluetooth was connected all the time. So I'd say battery backup is good and if you don't play any games then it might last you around 9 hrs of SoT.- Fingerprint reader is fast and working good.Many are facing other issues but I haven't faced any of them including network problems. But if faced, you can go to community where they have shared some suggestions which might help you out.Also I haven't switched to 60hz, during all these usages, screen was at 90hz.Overall performance is blazing fast and device feels premium.Great experience using Oxygen OS. 90hz is feels very smooth.In a sentence you can say that it's great device.

  A lot of thought has gone into every single component of the phone and it's evident while using it. The phone is buttery smooth and feels rather premium. This goes to show that that specs don't matter as much if you focus on delivering a killer user experience. That being said, my device has a touch of green tint when the background is grey but it's nothing major and it's only there of you are looking for it.

  Amazon delivered the product before the promised date. Packaging was good and exchange of my old phone took place without any hassle. Coming to NORD, it came with preinstalled apps such a as amazon, prime, Netflix and so on. Front cam could have been better as it‚Äôs not showing up true colors and contrast after the pic is clicked. 2 np Macro lens behind is useless. Amoled screen is very very good and sharp images and videos are displayed when you have a high speed broadband. Although I‚Äôm against Chinese brands, I did not have choice in the budget I had and Nord sort of checked all the boxes for me. Any non-Chinese brand coming up with good specs in limited budget then am all go for it. Until then will use Nord. Overall rating: 4 of 5

  I bought Nord Ash Grey 12gb Ram and 256 gb variant couple of days ago.Pro :-1. Phone is smooth and works bloatfree.2. Sound quality is good too3.Normal gaming can be done smoothly without lag.4. Charging is quick and device gives 8 hrs of screen time after full charging.Cons :-1. This device gets heated very much, even if I am just browsing and scrolling social media. I can feel the warmth of the device as if it is burning.2. Green and purple tint issue in lower brightness at night can be seen easily,which was disappointing for me as first time one plus user .3. Camera is not upto the mark if you are looking for photographyOverall,I loved this device so far but I was disappointed by green tint issue and also heating of device. So please do check phone before buying if you are night users like me then tinting issue is serious for you guys. I requested for replacement today and Amazon confirmed it too . I also attached the tinting issue pic here in this review so  you will find it useful. Thnx for reading.

  Well missing basic features of parallel app, no dual Sim, missing call recording although some video claim but unable to see sweeping left right. Phone is also bulky, using 5T for a long time and not impressed with it. It may be a good one for new phone users but a clear cut in features of a good premium phone. I am trying to return the phone but Amazon arrange a technician to visit to check missing dual Sim, parallel app and recording features. A clear no go from my side. Yes may be good for a first time buyer

  First i have many expectations on nord,may be  because of those expectations i am not so satisfied with the product.but for this price u can try other mobiles. I couldn't listen my phone ring if i am little far away from it.but when I play songs in it,the sound quality is good enough.as the ram is 12 gb its fast enough.when its about cam quality not as good as flagship phones. The micro lens is  not at all good as its just 2mp.Those who want to own oneplus but have less budget can go with this but have to sacrifice some considerations like camera quality...,ring quality.This review was written after using it for one month. The battery life is awesome after its fully charged it can be used continuously for 6 to 7 hours..and it also take very less to time charge as its a warp charging.27% charged in 10 mins nearly(23 to 50)

  Amazing product. One plus nord. I was sceptic about buying this initially but thought of giving a shot. Trust me , the product is amazing. Performance and camera is awesome. Battery life could have improved a bit as I feel the battery drains quickly in idle time. It was 73 percent in the night when I stopped using the phone and when I woke up in the morning , it was showing 52. So 21 percent was the idle drain of the battery in the night. Not happy with this alone. Hope One Plus will come up with an update to solve this issue.Apart from this I am totally happy and satisfied with this product.Thanks Amazon and thanks One Plus.I got this Special Edition in the Amazon Great Indian Sale and trust me, this color is the best when compared to the other two colors.

I don't understand why they gave the quad camera set up..

  Just after 2-3 days it started hanging and most of the app gets crashed and phone gets rebooted automatically.  Battery back up is also very poor. when i contacted the customer care of oneplus, they sent some setups but it did not work.  Then they suggested to contact service center.  I contacted service center they told that its a software problem and they reinstalled teh software.  But even after that the same problem persists.I mailed to oneplus for the replacement on which they said to contact amazon.  But in amazon it shows that return period is over.  So this is the punishment i am getting for trusting oneplus brand and after spending 30000 I am being tortured and feeling cheated.  I would once again request oneplus and amazon to replace my phone with new one or refund my money.

  1.Finger print reader and face recognition is on mark! Work ultimately and can assure that none of the phones with similar budget can't provide with same work2. Battery life is kind of average. However it can be compensated by fast warp charger which can charge within half an hr. It better to carry a charger when you travel.3. Camera quality is also kind of average. Comparatively I feel one plus 6 camera works well.4. Phone touch and performance are class like all one plus phones give.Totally, A person who needs phone casually can buy this( a good option). Its not recommendatory for those who uses phone continually with little pauses and who is kind of phone photographers.

  Overall I am satisfied with the product.The performance is amazing so is battery life. Gaming is decent. The Backside glass material is very attractive and gives you a premium feel.Here come a few minor cuts they have made, the camera is an average especially micro cam, if you compare with the recently released pixel which is of similar price rate. The display is good but not the 'The Best'. The frame material of the mobile is plastic, so be a little careful if you wanna use it without a case. These are minor issues. For a normal user, majority don't notice.But if you are a frequent or a passionate photographer, I think you would be a lit bit disappointed. Or if you a hardcore gamer, I think there are better mobiles in the market.But I can assure you that it balances all the features you want to find in today's smartphone. If you are buying in 2020 it is 'The best' overall purchase in its price range.

  After using this phone I realized that my previous phone which I bought 3 years back is much better.  2 major concerns that I found were an extremely bad camera and screen.

Seems like OnePlus used some very cheap quality products and got this out so that people realize that OnePlus 8 is really worth it.

  There are different displays comes with this phone and when I compared with each Oneplus Nord device (out of 3) only 1 device has brighter displays. Whilst inquiring this  issue in service center, service engineer says even after you replaced the screen the issue persists  and you have  to adjust with it . Even the display spare in service center has faulty one and tricks will be played by saying yellow tint .I presume that 1 in 100 device comes with display fault.Furthermore ,heating and battery drain issues are significantly higher even after normal apps usage ( W/O games,video calls, camera).Compromise has been made in the display segment , when you try to read any pdf documents you will come to know that . In my suggestion Oneplus Nord in July Batch manufactured phones has serious hardware issues and the company has tried to solve with software and the results failed after  trying with serious of updates10.5.3, 10.5.5, 10.5.6, 10.5.8.

  The Nord disappointed me at the beggining, but with every update the phone started showing its true potential. With a decent battery life, which is not a problem because of the Dash Charge the phone works fine throughout the day. The main camera is the USP of this device, which works perfectly fine for me, (have a attached a few images testing the various features of the camera) the remaining cameras are also showing improvement with each update, but it may take some time to be as perfect as the main 48MP camera taken from the OnePlus 8. Overall the phone is near to perfect at this price point and the 12GB RAM + 256GB space is definitely a banger packed in a beautifully crafted phone.

  Overall its a good product with little tweaks here and there.Very much sufficient and smooth for normal usage.For camera, the main 48 MP sensor is good. I was able to get some good quality pictures in good lighting. The front camera is also really good.An unnecessary 2MP macro camera.Face Unlock is quick, but the Fingerprint reader is a bit slow.During the first usage after unboxing, the phone heated up pretty significantly, but the problem subsided during succesive uses and now its runs with a minimum heating.Battery life is good enough to get you through a 9-10 hr screen time ( not gaming) and the 30W warp charger delivers as promised.At low brightness in dark background there is a purple tint on the bottom part of the display. But its not that bad, and is not visible while watching videos or other media content.

  The phone battery charges just 20% after 2 hours of charging.  While other features are fine, we understand there's an issue with this particular set.  We have, on multiple occasions, put requests for technician to visit and assess the phone set.  For first visit, the technician came suggested to let the phone drain completely. The second technician wrote back an incorrect report, while confirming us a replacement in 2-3 days.  The third technician closed the request without ever visiting.This has become a harrasment leading us to believe that this is a scam, where in, knowingly Amazon and the vendor are taking no steps to replace a faulty set.

  Reviewing after 2 days. It's good budget phone. But better than MI Realme Samsung.Might be they brands can give you more features in this range. But we all know all brands mobile performance slow after 1 year.But it's one plus brand it runs smoothly even after 2 year.Now pointing on this Nord -Back cemera is good but front cemera could be more better.Battery is pretty good not too. Because 90HZ phone so battery drain sure will.If you customize your mobile in 60 HZ so ur battery gives more life.Speaker so good.Bluetooth connectivity amazing.Ram adjustment nicely.Handy phone, smart access. Look premium.Overall I'll give 4 star.Main things that phone customization is too good.Best for multitasking.No heating issue.One thing I'll clear now. Whenever u buy new phone and then do on that phone. Every phone will heat first time or 1 days at least because their parts are start now to run. So don't tremble for heating issue.

  Writing a review after using this OnePlus Nord for 5 days high usage.First of all it's look like premium mobile (ignore frame as most of users will use protective case). In normal usage it gives about 1.5 day battery usage and in high usage it gives approx 1 day battery backup. I didn't notice any issue regarding display even in very low and high brightness as many of users reported.Pros.1. Battery backup is awesome2. Looks premium3. Smooth display4. Camera is good5. No bloatwares & ads6. No stereo speaker but speaker is loud and clear7. Good video viewing experienceCons.1. Very fews apps are supported in Parallel Apps2. Camera is struggling in low light3. Depth sensor and macro sensor cameras are worst. No meaning of this sensor and I don't know why they add this camera, just for quad camera setup.I will update this review after using this device for few more days and sure update soon if I notice any issue.

It gives a touch of premium phone, oxygen OS works smooth. I am a normal user and use it mostly for calling and social media browsing, as if now phone has performed smoothly. Apps work smooth, Camera quality is also good compared to my past Samsung and mi phones. Sound quality is good, fingerprint sensor works smooth, warp charging works well and you can have a 50% battery in 30 minutes charging.

Otherwise a good phone for first time oneplus users who r planning spend 25-30k. Very poor camera, either oneplus is cheating by saying its the same camera from oneplus8 or oneplus 8's camera is very poor. Did'nt feel quality and sturdiness. My initial plan was to sell my oneplus 6, but i ended up selling the new nord, You can imagine the resentment i had after buying oneplus NORD.....I recommend oneplus users not buy NORD, INSTEAD go for oneplus 8/7/7T.

Main features I loved most is OnePlus UI it's very clean and crisp compares other Android phone UIs ( Samsung and other Chinese phones)3. Processing is pretty decent not felt any lag or freezing issue ( not a gamer mostly uses office applications and social media and online streaming apps)4. Built quantity is very good you can feel it when you hold the phone , very good weight balance as per the size of the screen5. No heating issue while long duration calls and online meeting sCos1. OnePlus is Chinese company.  as I said I was looking for below 30k phone and I don't find any better suit in the market I have tried Samsung m30s and a51 in couple of weeks but both phone has lot of issue including software bugs and heating issue

  Simple and direct review! The phone is so perfect about everything, from battery to performance! Its true thats its a well balanced phone!The only problem is that it doesn't work that good in low light photography, especially for selfie. I personally purchased this because of camera bcoz I'm so socially active and I was disappointed with low light thing!thats it! Overall its the coolest phone you will have so go for it!

    Worthy Buy! And feels premium enough
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is pretty good. What you would expect is delivered. The software is amazing if you are coming from something like oppo/vivo/redmi etc. Almost feels like stock android and this will get updates quick and for another 3 yrs i think. So it's smooth and it's amoled so it's good  and ofcouree the 90Hz makes it smooth and processor is good enough to run almost all games maybe not at the highest graphics but definitely good for this price range and has 5g so future proof and i did not go through the camera much but don't expect too much. It's not amazing or mindblowing but it is one of the best in the price range except for pixel 4a ofcourse and ultra wide amd other cameras are average. The main camera is pretty good. Battery drains slightly quicker if you keep it at 90Hz but good enough and the charging speed is 30W so that's good and the experience feels good. The vibration motor and haptic feedback are better than the other phones in this price range. So overall a worthy buy. If you want grear cameras go for pizel 4a

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Overall a good phone. Nothing unique, above average battery life, decent user experience and good display. The tint can be noticed when something dark grey appears, like a blank chrome page. When something absolutely black appears, no tint issue can be noticed. The camera is good, primary, wide and front. Pictures are colour accurate and detailed but sometimes turn out  to be a bit over exposed and white balance is inconsistent. I tried using Gcam, it produced a better results comparatively. But the OnePlus camera at its own is still good. The fingerprint reader is fast enough and face ID too. You will need to unlocks some features for more smoother experience. I will definitely recommend this phone for content consumption, camera and casual gaming.

  Just got the device today in the afternoon - it's been a beast so far :D.Fingerprint reader works fine, and I'm yet to completely test the battery life. The 90Hz AMOLED display is a sweet addition to this device for this price point.The Onyx Gray looks and feels premium, atleast for the sub-30k price point. And the 12GB of RAM nakes the phone blazing fast, atleast fresh out of the box.The packaging beats the likes of premium OnePlus devices, and the mix of Black and Teal is a welcome combination.So far, it's been a good experience with this device.

Since it is loaded with Google dialer, it is not having automatic call recording. If one needs to record, one need to press button while call and other person will also know, call recording has started. For me it is single most worse feature.Old oneplus phones had inbuilt recording feature.Second big disappointment is camera quality is not fabulous but normal quality. My old Samsung A7 2018 phone was better in camera quality.

  Received the product in 4 days.The product got so much hype that I was forced to buy this. Especially this blue marble colour with glass at the back is so mesmerizing.Good battery life, i just charge it once in a day and it goes on with moderate usage.30W charging just makes it charge 70% in 35 minutes approx.Camera quality is awesome but micro camera and depth sensor is just a waste. They could have applied that cost in making ultrawide better but after considering all the facts, the phone is worth a buy for this cost you are getting a good brand good battery life, 48mp main camera which makes your experience better, especially 5g support and chipset does not make you feel behind any flagship model. Also it shows a very good quality in nightscape mode.So its a buy rating from my end but I am giving 4 stars bcz of micro camera.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I was very much excited to get this product, but I'm feeling bad for choosing this mobile as it has more cons than pro's.Camera quality is very bad, the first thing I did after switching on the phone was to click a picture and was very much disappointed with the image captured. A cheaper phone would take nicer pictures. Also the image saving takes a second or so gap, so finding it difficult to capture moving objectsApps are hanging a lot while using multiple applications at same time. Screen is getting frozen for few seconds (15-20) and as a fast hand person I feel very much frustrated.Not a mobile expected from one plus. I fell for the brand name, and it's a life time lesson.I don't recommend this mobile if you expect good speed and good camera quality. Other than these features I didn't expect anything else from one plus brand.

  I never ever sign on to leave a review.  But i didn't want others cheated into this.  This phone is all bark and no bite.  I got the new Ash grey 12/256 version just a few days back.  And 3 days in I'm already just an inch away from asking for a refund and sending it back.  The Google chrome doesn't work.  70 percent of the time the Google search fails and no matter how many times you refresh it you can't get through.  That's horrible when you need some information in a hurry.  And the auto call recording is non existent.  When I do manually turn it on it allerts the person on the other end that the call is being recorded. People have brought the issue up on their threads.  There have been no response so far.  People have been ckmplinkng about it from as early as August from the looks of their thread.  They just don't give a rats ass apparently.

  OnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.PROSSuper display { fluid amoled }Fast charger / battery backupDesign, weight, thicknessOverall good performanceCONS plastic framingMacro and depth no use worst cameraNo headphone jackWhile in dark mode you can face some colour issues in Google crome.If you are a gamer or like to get the best performance just go for realme x3 or redmi k20If you are a overall medium user you can go for it.

  This is the best phone one can buy within a budget of 30k. I was pretty much confused at first, as there were many negative reviews about the nord, but finally I decided to buy the 12gb variant.And all I can say is it's completely worth it as i wanted a phone for multimedia purpose which requires good camera, good resolution in display, smooth performance. The nord completely meets my expectation.Battery could have been a lil bit better but also don't forget that the device runs in a 90hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to 60hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too, charges from 0-100 in around 70mins, which is quite good i suppose.People saying it's a over-hyped phone, it ain't, other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market!Go for it without a second thought, you won't regret.

  I didn't pay much heed to 5G before buying but to cut down a few thousands, i went for nord rather than 7T.Now, to my surprise, wi-fi  calling made calling much easier since i can make calls even when network isn't available.Below are points to note:Camera isn't as awesome as 7T.Processing is lower than 7T but enough to work with heavy load- heavy games.Comparing to 3T which i had before, screen is very smooth and convenient to use.Now, what i also really miss is 3.5 mm jack since type-c to 3.5mm jack wasn't in box and charging BT earphones every second day is effort in itself.SO, for an upgrade after 2-3 years, it feels great. Go for it. For gaming and super heavy usage, got for 7T. For awesome camera, go for pixel 4A.& if you need all of the above, spend more money..!

Trust me if you do this you might be in direct competition with Apple.

Battery is not enough , drains out very quickly.I just unboxed it , it was at 48 and just after 10 mins without even playing any high end content or gaming, only few clicks and lil bit browsing the juice went down to 35 , seriously.Not sure it's because of that 90 Hz refresh rate which I didn't feel anything different.Overall I would say does not meet expectations and not worth to wait for months to get it.

  Phone is decent but the price is a bit more looking at the specifications they provide on paper vs the actual performance you get.I replaced my Nord in 2 days as the display apart from showing green and pink tint even on brightness above 50 percent exhibits a dark purple patch that was affecting my daily day to day usage.You'll be lucky if your unit is not plagued by such display issues.Cameras are not even average they lack focus and clarity even in full lighting, but that can be improved via Software updates.But tinting issue can't be fixed with a software update.

  Pros : -Great amoled panel with 90hz display.Bloatware free Oxygen OS with 3 years of updates.Sufficient battery. 30t warp charger.No heating issues while long hours of gaming.765g processor for smooth daily usage and gaming.Gorilla glass in front and back which gives it a premium look.Cons:-Dissapointing cameras. May be it can be fixed with further updates.Plastic frame which may lead to durability issue. This can be confirmed only after long usage (more than a year or two).No 3.5 mm jack.

  Best value for money. With frequent updates sometimes Oxygen OS becomes buggy such as Google can't connect to internet problem, Google Chrome doesn't load search results, Google Web search and define on a selected word doesn't work properly (shows no internet). These are some issues I faced, which I did not faced other phones having Google.

  I was a bit worried to buy this phone as I had never had a one plus before. My husband has a S10 and I an iPhone XS MAX. I have to say for the price I paid for this the screen is great, the speed is fantastic. The colour is one of the things that I really liked about the phone and I also got the sandstone blue case from one plus which lets me see the blue colour of my phone with some protection. The camera is alright. It hasface and fingerprint scanners. Bluetooth works well. Also it feels very light after my XS Max. Very happy with the purchase..

  I have been using this phone almost for one month now....I have one major issue...that is the image processing....it takes a while after the image is captured...if you capture and immediately move your hand, the image will be blurred...I hope one plus listens to this major drawback of this phone....otherwise it's a good midranger phone....the battery life is good not great ... fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't identify fingerprint.... camera quality is not as great as the brand has promised but it's still good not bad actually....but I think vivo x50 which costs 35k is a better phone than one plus nord

  Received a product with too much tint issue. Greys were green and pink tinted even at 100% brightness. I returned it. The product as such without considering this issue was great. I returned this unit and got another from a local store. There is very less tint issue in my new unit. I would totally recommend it. Its fast and smooth. Also Oxygen OS is a big plus. Camera performance is also decent. More than enough for normal users.

  Pictures are blurry and grainy. Written 32 MP but it's not even clear as 6MP to 12MP. Totally upset due to camera poor quality.

I would recommend if you want a fast operating mobile Nord otherwise, if you are looking for a best camera experience then don't try this which will waste your valuable funds....

  It drains the battery very fast. It consumes 10-15% battery during your sleeping hours when not in use.During call receiving or calling someone, both the sim cards loses its connectivity.

Initially I thought it might be my car‚Äôs temperature in the morning hours but even in evening around 8 with just 30-45 mins of gps usage, boom temperature alert!

  Except camera quality everything is just good, there are quad camera setup but third camera from top to bottom it is never working neither in portrait mode or night mode or wide angle mode or normal camera, it just never used. I think it is kind of gimmick to show that four camera setup. Apart from this the Oxygen os is just awesome as always, battery is mediocre, it runs almost a day for me. I think black onyx is much better color then the blue marble, I purchased bluemarble and it looks nice and funcky but not decent. Onyx Black is much more decent.

  Finger Print reader and face unlock are working very fast.Battery life is good.But Camera Quality made me disappointed. I Never expect that One Plus can give such a cheap quality of camera. When pictures clicked it looks like the mobile picture of 10k or 15k range. Slowmo camera of this phone is not working whenever I tried it it started dimmering. It seems one plus doesn't give much attention on this model and take it for granted. In the beginning I faced many bugs. Suddenly Mobile started to heat and battery was drained quickly, Pixels of picture was torn.Processor and performance of phone is good. But again I'll say worst camera.Lookwise this is good and lightweight.

And now even when idle.Lags while switching between apps (So much for 12GB RAM!)Screen freeze so I can't receive callsFront camera quality is averageCan't believe the Nord has such basic problems.

One plus 6 was better than this though it was just 2-3K higher than this phone. I would say looking at its overall quality, its definitely over-hiked phone. I think we can get phone with equivalent features at 15-18K of another brands. I am very disappointed with its poor camera quality, as I just picked this up - thinking camera would be good compared to others phone.

  The unit that I received doesn't have the infamous display tint issue and the battery life is also excellent. Now the phone is running OOS 10.5.5 and I get an average of 7 to 8 hrs SOT with basic social media and youtube and not to mention I don't game in this phone and definitely no PUBG. Camera is not the best but sufficient for an average user like me and I believe it will be improved in the coming updates. Build quality is awesome and feels premium for a user upgrading from a below 20k phone. I use Vodadone and VoLTE isn't yet supported by vodafone for this model. It's an excellent choice if you want a premium experience under a budget.

  For the price of 29,999 , it really performs well . Till date I don't face any lag . Oxygen OS is cool . Camera quality is superb (excluding macro camera) "" There's no screen tint issues "" as rumoured . So dont worry about screen tinting . Thing I hate about the oxygen os is you can't record an ongoing call without the other person knowing that  you're recording their call . Because when you press record call it's says ' The call is being recorded ' both to you and the other person on the call too ! It's annoing . OnePlus should fix this issue .Battery life is descently good . Gaming performance is also good (smooth 60FPS) . But games do drain battery faster than expected . Charing speed is literally mind-blowing . I appreciate it ! Overall it's a TopNotch Budget OxygenOS phone . I recommend BUYING one for sure

  Fingerprint reader was good.Battery life was not much good as I've expected.And another thing is the heating issue.The phone heats up while charging and the charger too heats up with the phone.Camera quality was good but the front camera video was not good.It is not having the mirror effect we can't change it on our choice.We can change it on oppo and realme phones but here in OnePlus there's no option available to change.It's default.And the last thing I would tell is that it's not having a SD Card support.It would be better if it would have SD Card Support.Overall I'll give 4 Star to this phone.It's a good phone but it's heating issues are a bit problematic for me.

  Superb PhoneOnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.

After spending 30k (which is huge amount for me) I was not expecting this from OnePlus device.My only suggestion is.. if you can spend 5-6k more...then go for 7t.My feeling for nord is like...""Maza nhi aaya""I finally yesterday asked Amazon to replace the products .

  It's been less than a month I bought this phone and there are already so many scratches on the phone. The screen is pathetic, it keeps attracting so much dust that I have to keep cleaning every one hour to have a clean screen. I am so disappointed with this phone, no value for money. Also another disadvantage cannot plug in head phones. As it was not enough to spend this amount for this useless phone now I have to spend a heavy amount for the ear buds. And everyone knows how horrible Amazon customer service is, they don't even consider customers as humans after 10 days of return window. For USA return window is 30 days, for India its 10 days.

My battery life is usually 8 to 9 hours as I am a heavy user but 30 W charger is quite fast. I can play games without a hitch and browse Instagram with a lot ease and grace. I really recommend this to all those who can afford it as it is a future proof device.

  Pros:1. Oxygen OS2. Battery life3. Warp ChargeCons:1. Display tint2. Camera below par except the main cameras on both front and backBuy this phone for regular usage and the performance will be as expected from a OnePlus device, smooth. The display does have tinting issues, which might or might not be resolved through OTA updates. The cameras barring the main sensors are below par. The fingerprint reader is quick and recognises almost everytime. The battery can easily last a day under normal usage.Considering Oxygen OS11 will deviate from stock Android UI , might have to think twice before buying.

  ¬†I am having a great experience in using oneplus nord as my primary device. I have attached few of the camera samples you can check them out to get the accurate idea about the quality it delivers. Talking about battery life, i agree that its not that good but after the update power consumption is improved to a great extent and the result is visible as well ( u can have a look on the ss attached ..)Battery life - 9 hours of screen on time  with moderate usage ( including asphalt 9 ,youtube Instagram , and normal day to day surfing )Coming to build quality yes it does have plastic frame but i can assure you of the premium feel while holding it but still you have to put it in the cover almost all the time to ensure safety.Conclusion - Each and everything is moderate about nord including the price.

Full-screen display: the 6.4"" display gives you amazing viewing experience.3.Rear camera: The rare camera does an absolutely fantastic job both in daylight and at night. I was actually mesmerized by the nightscape mode, though it feels that the photo was captured in daylight it does an amazing job.4. fingerprint sensor and face lock is quite apt and fast5. Tint issue: I didn't find any tint issue on my phoneCons:The only drawback for me is the front camera but I guess oneplus will resolve the problem. The problem is after zooming, the pictures appear to be grainy, if you are viewing it on a normal mode you won't see the issue, it is only seen if you zoom in.That's the only problem I haveOverall the phone is worth every penny and I'm happy to have it

This could be issue with software or hardware but didn't expect from one plus. Thankfully Amazon troubleshooting app detected it and I could returned the product. Please try charging phone first before login into Google.I have not experienced this kind of issue with phones I have used like motorolla,samsung,redme,lenovo.Hope others wouldn't be getting such issues and if you experienced something like it after replacement policy is over then I think phone needs to be given in one plus service centre and it would be headache for us.

  I have been using Nord since 5 days. Seems to be pretty much good.Pros :Display - Amoled display with refresh rate of 90Hz makes the display very smooth.OS - The oxygen OS is by far the best user friendly OS.Battery Life - Battery life is pretty descent. With refresh rate set to 60 Hz and normal use, (Social media apps and camera) the battery lasts for 8 - 9 hours (Screen usage time).Warp Charge - Charges from 0-100 in 52 minutes and 15-100 in 46-48 minutes.Processor - Phone doesn't lag a bit (No heavy gaming) Snapdragon 765g is powerful.Camera - Videography seems to be good.Cons :Camera - Out of the 4 camera(rear) only the main camera and Wide angle camera are good. Macro and the other camera are below average. Images are blurry with macro mode. If you're enough patient, click photos with pro mode.Design - The plastic body of the Nord makes this less safe and less durable.Finger print reader - In display finger print reader works on optical sensor which not fast.Pretty much more than the budget mid rangers also a little less than the flagships.

  Phone is pretty good at this price. You can definitely go for it.Front camera works very well as compare to rear camera. Rear camera needs to be improved by the updates. Performance is very fine as expected and 90hz display enhance your experience. Battery backup is fine as it goes for one day with single charge with heavy usage and it charges the phone in almost 1.20 hours.Experience on oxygen OS is damn good. And in hand feel of the phone is great as It's not that big and bulky.But there is a display tint issue and it is visible only in the dark but it will not affect you in any way. So just go for it.

  I think it was worth the 30k. Totally loved it. After reading some reviews even i got skeptical but i found no such issues of screen tint or battery drain. Camera is not bad, its still nice. If you are swithing from mid range devices you will totally fall in love with this phone else all iphone and oneplus 8 users would find it less premium whoch is obivious

  I got my OnePlus Nord yesterday. The very first day I checked my phone was for the green tint issue. The following night when I checked my phone, I see no green-pink tint issue in it. Also the black bar on the top through the punch holes cameras, aren't that visible. Like they get easily hidden away unless you intentionally look for it. Others things like the fingerprint reader and battery life are good and up to mark. About camera quality, I personally would say it as okay. Not impressed very much by camera quality or maybe I need to discover it much further to explore its quality. And the 90hz screen, overall processing and haptics are all good. For me, this phone is near to perfect for which I would give it a 5 star rating.

  The oxygen os is very smooth,gaming experience is good so far ,the os is highly customisable.I didn't observe any tint issue so far.Amazon delivery was very good with neat proctective packaging.Totally a nice phone for balanced users like me.Battery lasts for 1day after full chrage I get a screen time of 6hours easily with 90hz referesh rate.No heating issues . Continuous updates are given to fix bugs.Camera captures live colours and you can take insane shots with g cam.Build quality of the phone is pretty normal so put a  full tempered and a case and use it.The only problem that is personally face is no 3.5mm audio  jackCharge speed is super fast as claimed by the company

  Purchased this on the first day of launch. Was too excited for this but experience was too bad. The phone was defective and did't switched off after first day of charging. I asked for exchange but instead Amazon seller support executive advised they don't have any stock and also asked to not go with this phone as they are getting many complaints from buyers. All in all not this was an time wasting and very bad experience. And as I have bought this on EMI I will have to bear the GST charges. I would not suggest this phone to anyone.

  ¬†Over all it's a decent phone for this price. Great for someone who is looking forward to buy one plus. Oxygen OS is super smooth. One thing I really like is the filters in camera. They are doing a great job.Here are the cons I noticed:1. Front camera smoothens out everything. Images not that sharp.2. Whenever I search something on Google it shows offline though signal is quite good. If I redo the search twice or thrice it then gives the result.3. Face unlock doesn't work properly in dim light.4. Only 2 system provided font styles. One plus could have included few more fonts atleast.Apart from these down points the phone is a snatch.

  My first one plus phone. I dislike Chinese phones for the bloat ware that comes with phone. But oxygen OS is just like stock Android. Mobile feels good in hand. Back cover is sturdy enough to continue with it without buying a spare immediately. Screen guard provided with phone is very thin. One plus says it is to keep the on-screen fingerprint better sensitive.I am not a big fan of camera. I use it for general purpose. Camera is decent for normal use.No tint issue as told by many sites. Atleast to me.Happy with purchase.

  It's amazing & disheartening that One Plus Nord is unworthy of its price. Pictures taken with the phone shows green tint. The icons are more or less yellow in color.

It's way faster than the mobiles in this range and it can easily beat some mobiles a little higher than the nord. Everything's great and I'm happy with it. I was also unsure of the color but when I got it, I knew it was the perfect choice. I used for a whole day and the battery backup is also good it can easily last from morning to night. Oneplus really did a good job

  Pros -1. Excellent AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate. (Ignore the tinting issue hype as it does not cause any problems in day-to-day usage)2. Smooth Oxygen OS experience - No ads and extremely fast!3. Fast charging and decent battery life4. Good build quality (Though it is plastic frame, it is quite sturdy)Cons -1. Processor could have been a better one (Though 765G not at all a bad one)2. Pricing could have been a bit less.Overall, its a nice phone!

  I really liked this product a lot. but there are some cons like the front camera is not that good and also the macro doesn't click good pictures.I have to say this Amazon Customer Service is not that good. I constantly tried to get my product delivered on time but they refused to provide any reason until i posted order details on Twitter.

  It's as smooth as the other flagship one plus phones in regular usage. Cameras are good, except the macro lens, it's useless. Instead you get good macro shots using the main lens. Video stability is awesome as it has OIS. No problem in the connectivity. Call quality is good. Speaker is loud and clear enough. The amoled display shines, no doubt in its quality, it's great. Battery backup is ok, but not great. No problem because it charges fairly fast with other chargers also. With the warp charge it charges really quick.

The phone is fully charged in around one hour, also for charging 10-15mins you can use your phone whole day with optimum use.Only thing you miss in this product is 3.5mm Jack, if anyone face issue in Jio Network i.e. because of call over wifi setting enabled, you just need to switch the setting to call over mobile network in Calling preference menu.Thanks OnePlus for the awesome product.

  Battery life and charging is really good that too for a 90hz screen. Display is the best and I don't have a green tint issue. The phone is really smooth and OS is very clean. Camera is not as flagship level and it was honestly terrible at the beginning. But it has improved since the special update Nord received. I installed Gcam and it is amazing much better than stock. Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price and little bit of future proof as 5G is coming.

    Camera Quality
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors.The colours are crisp without any unwanted over saturation and the images come with a good amount of detail. But the experience of the camera depends a lot on the overall lighting and the lens you are using.

  After using it for over 20 days, I would like to point out one big dislike - the screen near fingerprint reader has noticeable tints. You can notice it while watching videos, playing games. Secondly, camera quality in low light is not so good, but in good lighting, you can see the images are pretty good. You can see the red color varieties and its distinction. Battery life, video and gaming experience is worth it for a phone at this cost price. If you want a durable mobile, go for it without a doubt.

  I'm writing this review after using this one plus nord (12gb,256 varient) for a week. I'm new user to one plus series ,So was much excited to buy this mobile. Now I'm so much disappointed battery life of the mobile is so worst, I need to charge my mobile every 6 hours even with low usage, camera quality is not even like redmi. SIM is not working properly, everytime it's coming as switched off. Other than classy look everything else is disappointed

  Writing this review after using it for 1 week. It's a awesome phone with lots of new things. Best camera both the rear and front one. Battery life is not that great. It manages to last for only one day with moderate use but not to forget about the fast charging. Overall I would say a nice phone, stylish with good camera and you can customise the display, color and many other things as just you want your phone to be.Thank you One Plus for bringing this midrange phone to the market.

  Actually I am not a heavy user so this phone works fine for me but One Plus claimed that the battery charges from 0-70% in 30 mins which is actually false. In 30 mins it charges from 0-55%. The camera is average, takes 1-2 seconds to process after clicking the photo; if you immediately move it away after clicking the photo, then the photo gets blurred. Battery life is normal, it lasts for more than a day on normal usage.Buy it if you want a OnePlus experience.

  Oneplus as a brand i purchased the Oneplus Nord. But i would suggest Honor i.e huwai phone and software is excellent. Oneplus Nord missing basic functionality like whenever i call there is an mute button on phone which gets pressed in every call multiple times. I think oneplus team has missed to give focus on the basic calling functionality. There is no option to remove mute button. Further phone doesn't have basic copy feature like u can't copy selected text from sms you want. Entire message gets copied.Only Look wise and other features are good.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The phone is good. However LED brightness control is controlled using PWM (pulse width modulation). Meaning instead of turning the brightness of One plus Nord turns of the screen and on for 240 times or so per second. This one way of reducing brightness in LED display. The problem is when you scroll the screen images are torn. This happens in fractions of seconds, for some this may give eye strain and headache. This can be captured by taking recording the display  from another mobile or camera in slow motion. I regret buying this phone.

  Its an awesome phone and the great thing about this phone is Oxygen os with fluid amoled display. Camera is good but not awesome. It just average. And ya performance is great. Battery life is also decent could be enough for entire day. Its dash charger can charge phone really fast.Screem protector that is already applied is not good. You need to change it. Overall a good package phone.I pre ordered it on 15 july and waiting for that assured gifts. Let see when it comes.

    Don't Buy Nord If you Want Oxygen OS or Call Recording
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  If you are concerned about pure Oxygen OS and record calls frequently don't get Nord. Because, Nord comes with Google Phone Dialler and Google Messages app instead of OnePlus native apps which lacks many features. There is no option to auto call record and even if you press the call record button while calling, the person on the other side can also hear ""This call is being Recorded"". This is just because of the Google dialler and OnePlus says it's their collaboration with Google.

    Waste of money: Battery and Camera Issue
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Worst product, seems like 10,000 Rs product. Waste of money, as battery life is worst. It got charged fast as well as drain super fast. If it's 100% charged, it reduces to 10-20% battery level within 5-6 hours without heavy use (no game, video watching). Camera quality is also average. So this is not expected from such costly product. Only good thing is touch screen. But Camera and Battery are critical things.

I am also expecting much more battery backup incoming days than the first day.The display and UI experience is outstanding I am having a happy mood while using the phone .I am giving a thumbs up for the phone expect the camera area

Have been waiting for the arrival of parts since 5 days. Oneplus customer care is also horrible. Have tried calling them since 3 days.

  Good performance so far. Battery drains when used in 90hz refresh rate. You will get a good experience even in 60hz refresh rateCamera could have been better.Video recording is perfect in this phone. Processor speed is very good and no lags. I am not a gamer so no comments about it.Call reception is very good. No heating issues so far.Go for it if you are looking for a better performance phone that can help you in your day today activities and support you with all office related apps

  Network issue, when you use two sim cards 2ith one vodafone and jio simcard, if you are using internet with vodafone, you can't make calls,Everytime you connect calls it will disconnect and turn off all network and com3 back after some time , so basically you need to change your network to 3g or 2g and you can't at all call when you are using vodafone 4g 2ith other sikcard on stand buy.Any simcard network catching is too much poor.

  Pre-ordered on July 28th, and delivered on Aug 3rd l, before actual sale!!Phone is very good in terms of apps and games performance, smooth display, battery life, Oxygen OS, front camera. Back camera is not that great or at par with flagships, but still it takes pretty good photos under normal conditions, so on usual days, it will work great.Only complaint is regarding bloatwares of Facebook and Netflix apps. That could have been avoided to keep the OS as clean as possible.

  The phone is a good attempt by one plus! The main camera works just fine but the macro camera is better not to be used.It's battery does a fine job but not as big as most budget phones that give us 9-10 hours of life. You can use it for atmost 6-8 hours.Price is much higher as compared to other phones with same features but Oxygen OS is a fulfilling ad free, bloatware free OS. That's the best takeaway from this phone.

I don't really know that it is a defect or it is happening with everyone.On this device, OnePlus has worked excellently and the most lovely thing about this is that it doesn't takes much time to charge. All over it is a good option but better options are available in the market in this price range.

  Big issue with Oneplus Nord is Bluetooth connectivity. Takes too long to connect bluetooth device, when connected it gets disconnect automatically.

Not expected these qualities and issues from Oneplus.OS 10.5.7 is awesome to use.

  overall product is really good. but when you have grey color on your screen (I have opened incognito tab for grey color) with 10-25% of brightness. you will be able to see the pink and green tint on your screen which is totally ignorable . only the thing hurt is you are spending around 30k with this low severity defect. but I am pretty sure Oneplus will fix this issue in next version update.Amazon delivery service is good

  I satisfied with the one plus Nord. The problem I can say the bettry life is not that great but needs to charge twice or thrice of day if you are using contineosly..but it will give satisfaction as it supports fast charging.Camera quality is average ..but for the price it is good.

  ¬†I regret buying this phone.Pathetic touch screen and the screen lagging within the first 2 days was highly unprecedented. Even a phone worth 6K won't hang within first 2 days.Pissed of at Amazon too as they didn't allow the return. Amazon deliberately scheduled a late visit by their expert technician so that the product return time is lapsed.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  After a long wait got oneplus nord. Quite difficult to use from normal android to stock android. Some features are missing like radio , dial pad prediction, camera clarity is awesome in normal and nature condition. Bt in room light its quite dull. Overall a compact phone for buyers.. If u have skyhigh expectation this is not the phone. Budget oneplus proves again as budget one...

    Do Not Go For Nord!!
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The camera is definitely not upto the mark. I am a OnePlus user from the past 6 years, but OnePlus Nord is a complete disappointment on the basis of a camera, knowing the cameras of OnePlus are too good. Plus, the battery life is not good as expected. I don't play any games on my phone, and yet the battery doesn't last long. I would definitely not recommend this phone for anyone.

  Good battery life. display is good.But Poor camera quality. For name sake 4 cameras are there. But 48MP has poor quality compared to it's 16MP. 48MP absolutely for marketing stunt.But for below 30k with 5g and SD u can go for it.

  My first OnePlus, maybe I expected a lot. But as per the price, this is what we get, right?IDK but battery doesn't stay longer it drops compared to other OnePlus, as my friend has OnePlus 6. His battery is much better, but it's 3000mah and Nord is some 4110 mAh. Thou it should stay longer than 6. It drops. As for me it's too soon to say as it's been a day since I got it. So let's hope for good.

  Oxygen os is the main highlight of this phone. It gives this phone a premium feel. And that's what makes this phone far better than other phones in this price segment. Fingerprint reader is awesome. Camera is decent, macro camera should be improved, but overall camera is good.Battery is sufficient given that this phone has 30w warp charger so battery is not a issue.Overall this phone is pretty good at a pretty great price.

  Beast phone in terms of look, design, and oxygen os experience. But battery shoud be more when compared to other competitors in market. Headphone jack should not be removed. Otherwise a good package. This small changes need to be done in oneplus phone, that will be make the phone more Powerful in its segment.

Multi tasking is pretty fluid. Warp charging is great. Full charges in close to 1hour and 15 minutes. In-hand feel is great. Doesnt give that plastic frame feel ever. And its 5g ready, whenever that is ready. Extremely happy with this purchase

  The camera quality is way more glnetter and a difgerent than other phones. Its OIS makes the camera mpre special. The 90hz refresh rate is like butter. But one cons about this phone is that it heats up when its charging. Some times the face unlock dont respond even if the face unlock symbol is upfront indicating. But this would be the one of the best phones you will get at this price.

Overall phone is quite good with fast and with nice look (especially blue colour ).

  Everything performance is good in this handset of OnePlus.. only battery drainage is the little problem..I'm satisfied with this product according to features given in it..I must say this is best phone in this price range.

    Camera Quality
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  3 star for Camera quality of Nord as expected is not upto that mark, Primary camera is good but Selfie and Night Mode camera is not as decent as expected. Night Images are not at all clear.Overall Oneplus Nord has made a huge hype in the market on camera but could not meet the expectation. Highly expected if the problem can be fixed providing upgraded version on its camera.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is absolutely an excellent phone at 30k with 12gb ram and 256gb rom. The fingerprint reader is genuine as top series as 7t,battery life is enough for one day, somehow in case of camera its is elegant and extraordinary in bright light condition but in full and low light condition it is not much as acceptable as a buyer. And at last thanks for oneplus for this astonishing phone..

    I highly recommend this device if you're not very particular in getting the best mobile photography.

  A solid device for daily usage with smooth performance by oxygen os. I like the oneplus community were you can post suggestions and issues which might get the attention of the developers for improving the device. Camera is decent, obviously not up to flagship standards. All in all an impressive device with premium feel and experience and only slightly lagging wrt camera performance.

  Frame is plastic... haven't Expected....+ The YouTube reviews are too much over paid... nothing so great about oxygen OS and nord itself. The camera cut out sucks...it kills content. + I hate the way the upper part darkens while gameplay

    Best phone of 2020 in 30k
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Bloody good product!!One plus has finally understood that the sub 30k is the sweet spot for them. People prefer Samsung and Apple for anything that's over 40-50kI bought 3T 3+ years back and it worked like a charm. Nord is same price range and definitely a best buy in Sep 2020 for 30k

    One of the best overall midsegment smartphone
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Well , it is what it is , a midsegment smartphone and it definitely has some setbacks like the 2 useless cameras on the back and the stereo speakers are not there which is kind of true for most of the smartphones in this range and it is like the norm for the midtier smartphone. Hence I would say this is one of the best overall midsegment smartphone.

  Calls not completed. Around 50% calls fail.Recipient unable to hear anything from my side. This happened for around 60% of my calls.Not receiving half of the incoming calls. Getting true caller notification saying incoming call from xyz, but call is not coming through. They had to send a text or make a WhatsApp call (which again had microphone problems)

  ¬†I was bit confused between M51, A71 and Nord. 5 days before I received this product and believe me you will enjoy using this device.Display is super awesome.90Hz of refresh rate makes device more smooth. About battery I charge once for an hour and it lasts whole day on normal usage.Camera quality could have been better.
