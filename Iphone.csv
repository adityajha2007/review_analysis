    Do not buy iphone or expensive product from Amazom

  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren‚Äôt working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren‚Äôt working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don‚Äôt regret after.

  This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn‚Äôt record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon !

  My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

    Beast with a limp
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware.

Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.

And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-‚Ä¢Wide angle camera‚Ä¢Supports fast Charing‚Ä¢Stunning looks‚Ä¢Superb Camera quality‚Ä¢Safe and secure device ‚Ä¢Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-‚Ä¢The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp‚Ä¢Still have huge notch‚Ä¢Bit costly in India

  Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.

This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.

  The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn‚Äôt respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it‚Äôs been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it‚Äôs the worst product from Apple. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it‚Äôs not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn‚Äôt work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don‚Äôt find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.

  From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

Battery life is amazing, the display, the face recognition, everything is amazing. Iphones are pricey, but the processor and everything is just amazing. Please make sure that you update your iphones to their latest version for smooth functioning. Overall very much satisfied with this one. And this is my mom with the mirror selfie as she loved the colour and was very much excited to click. üíö

  It‚Äôs just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don‚Äôt have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won‚Äôt go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.

  I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

  The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn‚Äôt up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung‚Äôs A 30‚Äôs which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can‚Äôt help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo‚Äôs with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn‚Äôt take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would‚Äôve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!

  If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future.

  I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren‚Äôt functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people‚Äôs complaints.

The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks

  Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!

  This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.

Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product.

    The best iPhone - perfect combination of features!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

  It's a bad buying experience from Amazon as they are not giving Amazon pay cashback as stated by their offer. Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting fine details of terms and conditions of the offer in so many places that you cant take screenshots of every place to get complete offer details handy with you and their usual cashback will come to one account after sales end. So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.Soon seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images iphone I doubt anyone can match that. But as per my experience It's better to buy it offline after checking it personally, spending few thousand bucks makes more sense rather than risking much larger amount. I am lucky phone comes out as original but I have heard about many fraud cases from both Amazon and Flipkart. So choose wisely

  After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.

  Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.  Some other good features: - Stereo speakers with great quality. - iOS provides smooth user experience. - The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good. - Amazing video quality - Excellent selfie photos.Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ‚úåüèº

That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera.

After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...

  I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.

It‚Äôs camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge.

  Superb. It‚Äôs a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don‚Äôt think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can‚Äôt multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?

I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

  This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

  hiI had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon.But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to serversFinding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work finebut it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to worktoday while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not workingI have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain

  Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ‚Çπ46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ‚Çπ68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ‚Çπ23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:

    Iphone vs Android experience
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)

  If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don‚Äôt always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it‚Äôs always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ‚Çπ1500 to ‚Çπ2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that‚Äôs the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice

  At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:Cons1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.6. This phone is heavy.7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. üòâü§´You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.Pros1. Battery backup is super in my usage.2. Camera's were as hyped.3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.5. IP68 rating a must have.If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.

Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.

  Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will be use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.

May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.

  The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‚Äòin-house‚Äô card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.

  Guys I have learned that there are two types of screen display color in iPhone 11. One is with yellow tint and other one is blue tint.  And my phone which I got from amazon is yellow tint which is very low in brightness. Blue tint is good and brighter. Do not purchase yellow tint phones. Not happy with amazon service as they are not exchanging to blue tint.

    A premium device for a moderate user.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  üòÖThis is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.

  So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.Hope with new release they will match with android.Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don‚Äôt even think of it.

Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android.

To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.WiFi reception is Average I would say.Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crispThe speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love itThe display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurateBattery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.The phone is slippery so I use a back case.Nothing more to say about i0S and it‚Äôs updates they are great

  To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus.It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone üò¢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.

  I generally don't prefer to buy any expensive electronic gadgets like iPhone from any e-commerce portal. I read many negative comments from the reviews section. My plan was to buy iPhone11 128 Gig and particularly Yellow color. I checked the Amazon Sale price and the market price and the difference was 5k INR. I still wanted to buy from the nearest apple authorized retailer but there was some technical issue with the HDFC card and I could not buy it. Then after thinking so much, I tried to buy from Amazon sale on 16th-Oct-2020. The iPhone arrives and I checked the product is fully compliance and 100% genuine. I got full 1 year apple warranty and the product model number. And the best thing is my iPhone is Make in India. I am loving it :) ...

  I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.

  Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don‚Äôt need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn‚Äôt agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don‚Äôt know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.

  Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.Thanks.

  I had iPhone 6s and it‚Äôs been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this.  unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing.Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice.There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its  better to avoid iphone dual sim models.The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software & camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.

  I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Apple üçé

  Camera quality and face recognition is amazing. First timers will have to spend time on setting up the phone as it is not as easy as android. The phone is not too big to hold nor too small. It‚Äôs just perfect and the performance is quite good since it has only been 1 day after I have bought it. Overall a very good product and I love it.

    The most perfect Apple iPhone today. No doubt.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.

  An awesome phone from Apple. Worth buying!Camera Quality is undoubtably the best in outdoor ! Indoor seems to be good, not great.Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.

  Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.

  Well I am first time iphone user and yes it's very annoying if u r android user for first few days and ofcourse u will not regret buying IOS.Over all building quality is top notch,camera is excellent. And battery backup is also good for regular usage and don't play games on it. Yes daily usage such as fb,insta,net surfing will not consume much battery I charge battery after 2 days when its gets completely discharge and annoying is charging takes around 3 hrs to full as it comes with 5V chargers.Rest everything is nice

They said 30 days replacement warranty. But when I choose the replacement option, they ask me again to talk with the customer care. poor service amazon

  I bought the iPhone 11 128gb white and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Pros:BatteryCameraDisplayProcessorCons:The charger provided is only of 5W.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here.

  I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone.

  Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.Pros:1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?Cons:1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.4. Read the terms and conditions ofApple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance.

  I am writing against all the negative reviews here. I have purchased iPhone 11 from Amazon sale on 23rd of Oct. If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I  have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.

    iPhone 11 best iPhone deal
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give ‚Äúamazing user experience‚Äù then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.ü§ò.

Had seen some reviews saying that the screen is not good, but let me tell you guys that this is the best LCD screen you‚Äôll ever get in an phone. The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it. And Apple operating system is holding up good and their Face ID is damn fast.I need not comment on the camera quality as it is among the best mobile camera that is available at this price range. I will post some pics clicked by the camera for reference.Talking about the battery life, it is kinda decent will last you easily for a day with more than moderate usage.Would highly recommend this if you are planning to buy your first iPhone.

  I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúrepaired tag‚Äù in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can‚Äôt demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don‚Äôt know what Apple is going to do.In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.

  Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker.Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage.Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020.Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason.But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue.

  I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don‚Äôt work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.

  I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.

But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league.

  I am an android user before and this is my first ios device. Before i wondered why people are spending their huge money to buy it, but now i realised why, let me tell u..Camera:Better in bright light conditions.. but it is not upto the mark in low light or night conditions..Battery:Which is best and lasts whole day with above avg usageThe functionality and apps handling is flawless and i can say that no one gonna regret by choosing this phone..My mobile was iphone 11 64 GBAnd i would like to thank AMAZON for great delivery on time and at this situation as we get so many fake or clone iPhones which i was bothering about.. but AMAZON did a great job and got a brand new original iphone!Thank you and go for it....

  Ordered on prime day of Amazon Great indian Festival, Oct 16th, 2020. Charger and earpods included in box. Delivered in 3 days, kudos to Amazon! Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)

    Best but Amazon ruined it ;(
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn‚Äôt quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn‚Äôt.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won‚Äôt allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ‚Çπ3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!

  Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  ¬†Pros:I‚Äôve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.Cons:I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it‚Äôs Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it‚Äôs a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It‚Äôll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I‚Äôm always wearing a mask and cannot face id.Overall it‚Äôs a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.

  Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it.The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone.

  My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it‚Äôs delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I‚Äôm the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there‚Äôs no question of sending refurbished device.Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S.  Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.Overall it‚Äôs great to have this phone.

  User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.Pros: 1. Best battery life in an iPhone  - 3110 mAh2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)12. Premium feel phone13. Its an iphone14. Good resale valueCons:1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)2. Minor software limitations as compared to android3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.Conclusion:I would personally rate this at 9.5/10If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it‚Äôs as easy as thatAnd as for me, I‚Äôm very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.

  it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time

  Keeping the review of the item aside. Never buy any costly items on the ecomm sites.Detail Explanation of problems faced:I bought the iPhone 11 128GB Black during Amazon big billion days happened between 16 Oct 2020 to 22 Oct 2020. Orderd on 16 Oct 2020 and it got delived on 18 Oct 2020. As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre.

If you're even tad bit confused on whether or not it is a great buy, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the price. Also, the delivery was smooth and hassle free.

Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.Owning a iPhone is a dream for many.

  I was also facing the heating issue with iPhone 11, bought in recent sale. After updating to ios14 the device was getting hot a lot and with no heavy use also. For me it got solved by factory resetting the iPhone 11 from settings. It‚Äôs reset all data and setting option . Since then it‚Äôs working fine for me no more heating issue. For those who bought it new and having heating issue, please try this hope it will work.üëç

  Great phone with a very good camera and FaceId feature. The phone does not have a finger print reader. It was very easy to transfer information from my old phone. Just switch on the new phone, connect it to wifi, plug both the old and new phone to power and place them snear each other. Then start the transfer process. in approx. 30 minutes its all done. All the apps, photos, songs etc. get transferred directly for the old device to the new device. No need for backup and restore. Then transfer the SIM from your old phone to the new phone and you are all set. Seamless!!!

  Apple products are usually very handy to use. This is awesome phone with very good touch in operation and good picture. Bit disappointed with battery backup as it gets exhausts by end of day with limited application running in background. Many new features like in built scanner and full page screen capture is very useful and easy to send and share. Very good Face ID detection.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Most pathetic and worst service from Amazon , I got a damaged product , iPhone 11 product I received was having damaged microphone and I confirmed the same from apple authorised service centre. After several escalation calls to Amazon customer representative, they committed on call that they will provide replacement of product and later they said Amazon technician will visit my place and inspect the product but the technician did not visit my place and customer representative finally says we will only refund and not replacement. After making the customer wait for 1 week , this is what they come up. Darshit Electronics cheats people by saying they don‚Äôt have mobile phone when asked for replacement of a damaged product but they have mobile phones to sell for other customers!!! Low level....Worst experience!!

  iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos

  The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown  and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn‚Äôt not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11. I change it every 4-5 years and must say the old phone still support most of the apps i have in this. This is a great investment if you value your money and time.

  Mobile device is good. Good upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected.  I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn‚Äôt hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.

  An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am. And also got it same at my residance with very speedily on 18th in safe n  superb packing.But after inserting sim card i hv noticed that incoming call ringer volume was not working,  i hv contacted APPLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM, they tried to resolve the problem,  through screen sharing,  they hv tried,  there level the best,  but couldn't get successed and saying that this is product manufacturing defect and advised to contact apple service centre, with sending me a (service centre) link, which was 400km away from  my residence.i explained my inability to opt it, hence he advised to contact AMAZON from which it was purchased .Then i hv contacted AMAZONE, customer service centre, described all these, then via via via an authorised executive talked with me,  explaining all the details and requested to help me out. He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards.  I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period  i hv  purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)Otherwise I could purchased  iphone 11 from apple store,  it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a  cutomer of AMAZONE.If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not  be possible for replacement.Salute to AMAZONE. I AM HIGHLY OBLIGED.Bharat Mansata.

  I know that the 'Worlds best phone' do not need any reviews. But still, I wished I should share my thoughts and experience about it.This product was delivered within time and thanks to amazons for delivering it on time.I got it checked & verified  at the time of delivery.I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, instead I am more happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.This phone is super smooth, thanks to A13 Bionic chip, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.Camera is another best thing of iphone 11, I repeat - The Best. No competition. You will have to trust me.Talking about the design and build quality, it is great either. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.Apple have improved the sound & audio quality in iphone 11. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer.

  Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.

The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged.

  Pros :Touch is really smoothBattery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.IOS14 update came within 2 daysSwitching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.ConsBattery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.Overall a nice product to buy.

The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation

    Iphone 11 great phone with good battery and performance
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.

  Am gonna divide into pros and consPros:Great cameraExcellent software experienceStereo speaker have depth in audioSmooth animationsBattery can last upto 1 day if you are a causal userLag free gamingIp 68ConsDisplay üòñ though you won't notice it but if you pixel peep you can certainly find difference.No fingerprint sensor. I feel fingerprint authentication is more convenient than face scanner.Huge notch feels outdated.Charging takes one eternity XD.VerdictIf you want a phone for long term usage then you can go for it but if your priority is better display and better charging speed better go with OnePlus or some other devices. Rest be assured 5g won't come soon in India. Still I think it's better than iPhone 12 considering price.

  Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can‚Äôt be beaten by any other device. It‚Äôs really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.

    Checks to verify your iphone is new
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didn‚Äôt like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and won‚Äôt be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care can‚Äôt connect with a person and their automated options doesn‚Äôt cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!üëç

So let‚Äôs talk about camera I would say bang on camera so good quality pictures in low light or in dark. In terms of performance phone nailed in that but only one problem I think I must include here is if you play PUBG or any heavy game like that phone heats not that much but it heats everyone is here complaining about heating problems trust me phone not heat while normal usage only when you play heavy graphics game like PUBG cod fort nite.

  I‚Äôll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps.

You can find many reviews saying that amazon delievers clone mobile please do not judge based on those reviews people just put fake reviews to get componsations and when they do not get anything for free they do such cheap stuff.

  Its nothing new that iPhones are amazing. You can get the actual reviews on youtube easily. I would like to tell that as I switched from an Android to iOS, there is a very big change that I am experiencing. Camera quality, call clarity, every single aspect of the device is top notch. I got the 128 GB model and after installing all the necessary apps for social media, ecommerce and payments, I have around 20 GB occupied. So even the 64 GB model is great if you are not much into making videos.

  I ordered iphone 11 64GB red on 16th octomber Great Indian Festival and got delivery on 18th octomber. after unboxing iphone switch on the device .try to capture some images and video the iphone backpanel is getting heated.on normal use like watching  videos getting heated ,even i havent install any appilcation on device.after contacting with apple support care they advice to upgrade OS version (from 13.7 to 14.0.1) but issue same . I ask to amazon for replacement or return ..but they saying that they dont have authority to replace/refund you have to go for service centre.if they dont have authority to replace/refund why they selling apple product.its just only 1 day after purchased and i had raised the issue even they have the 7 day replacement policy.So dont go on amazon for expensive product..think 100 times while buying..

    Bad experience with a Faulty phone!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Lured by the big discount during the sale bought an iPhone 11 128GB black phone. Extremely disappointed with amazon! You guys sent a phone with faulty screen! And there was no option of contacting customer care. All attempts were leading to Apple customer care details. Finally upon contacting the Apple customer care, they advised to take it nearest Apple service centre. The service centre was reluctant asking to contact amazon, as it was bought from amazon. The service centre guys mentioned that they have had many such compliants with regards to issues with iPhones delivered from amazon! Hope you guys are not delivering substandard and poor quality phones under the guise of discounted products!I would be henceforth very skeptical buying any high value products from amazon! Sorry to say this!

  Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!üòä

And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It‚Äôs been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can‚Äôt beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.

  First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you‚Äôll face no problem there.Screen response time is very accurate there‚Äôs no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you‚Äôre not getting a charger from now it‚Äôs not bad.When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can‚Äôt enjoy  it in 720p screen but it‚Äôs there.So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it‚Äôs around 55k so definitely if you‚Äôre going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.

  Upgraded from iPhone 6s 32 GB. Great Cameras (Wide, Ultrawide, and portrait modes). Exceptional battery life (Works up to 7 to 8 hours on iOS 14). Seamless experience. The phone is slightly heavier compared to the 6s. A faster chip (A13 Bionic). Face ID is great. WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great. This phone is highly recommended instead of the 12, due to the battery size (iPhone 11 has 3110 mAh, iPhone 12 only has only 2815 mAh).

Even after calling to customer care, there is no response and i've not got the cash back amount.This is really worst thing from amazon on cheating customer by showing discounts/offers/deals.

  One of the best iPhones. It has all the good features in a decent price. The good thing about Apple is that it gives you the same performance in iphone11 as the flagship iphone11 pro/promax. It just cuts down on certain features like display or an additional camera.Overall a good phone and a good experience till date.

  1st time bought an apple product, fully different experience. The OS is not user friendly like android but it's interesting.The camera quality is quite impressive. The night camera is also good, but there is a little issue which I was not supposed, and ie. when you move ur hand or any non-living object it blurs the image and I was supposing that iPhone will fix it... But the sensor is very good... face detection is awesome...

  Using my device for last 20 days and it‚Äôs been a great experience. I switched from Android to iOS and it seems to be a good decision now. Battery, Camera and Performance all are excellent. Display is not so great when compared Oled display in 11pro but still it is better than many Android phones available in market. Face recognition is superfast in any light condition. Only thing that irritates here is 5W slow charger but it keeps your battery health better anyways in hurry situations I‚Äôve to use 12W charger(bought separately). At the end I‚Äôm super happy with my phone.

Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers

  iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.

  Product is good as it‚Äôs an apple product, not much satisfaction with the seller as I ordered ones the money was deducted from account, in two hrs time I got a msg that need to revise payment as they have some issue , so I did so , twice the amount was deducted and the support system for cancellation of one order is really disappointing, I got both the phone & found really different to return one .

  Everythin about phn is so good.Only thing that i did not like is the adapter given for charging..It is of 5W only and it take almost 2.5 to 3 hra to charge your phn to 100%.When. You are spending so much amount then we should expect from apple to provide with compatible charger as they are giving in pro and max pro..

Great face ID, great screen (you cannot tell the difference between an LCD and an OLED when stuff is this compressed, don't let that be a factor), mind blowing cameras, outstanding battery life. Champ all around.

  Purchased in December.Decent phone with good battery backup as per apple standard.Camera is big upgrade from previous generation.iOS 13 can cause some hiccups but certainly a buy for apple lovers.For Apple haters : camera is quite good compared to pixel 2 and one plus previous generation.
